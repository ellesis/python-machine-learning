X

The company reported an adjusted loss of 10 cents a share on revenue of $272 million. Wall Street expected a loss of 9 cents on revenue of $269.5 million.

Pinterest stock dropped 9%, near 18.95, during after-hours trading on the stock market today.

Wall Street analysts will focus on what Pinterest has to say about advertising spending trends looking ahead, during the earnings call.

Ad spending is what Wall Street focused on when Facebook (FB) reported earnings last week. That was true as well when Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also reported results last week. Ad spending did indeed drop. But as it turned out, shares of Facebook and Alphabet popped the next day as analysts grew more optimistic that the situation was not as dire as thought.

Pinterest gave preliminary first-quarter expectations on April 17 and withdrew its revenue and earning guidance for 2020.

Strategic Priorities For 2020

""Our strategic priorities for 2020 remain content, ads diversification, use case expansion and shopping,"" the Pinterest earnings release said.



""The spread of Covid-19 has certainly had an impact on our business and the businesses of our advertisers, but we remain optimistic about the future,"" Pinterest Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said in written remarks.

The company did not provide revenue or earnings guidance for 2020, as expected. Pinterest said it expects to continue to grow operating expenses in the second quarter, year over year, but at a slower pace compared to the first quarter.

""The near-term financial impact of this pandemic is rapidly evolving and difficult to measure and quantify,"" the company said when it gave guidance on April 17. ""First-quarter revenue performance was consistent with our expectations through the middle of March, when we began to see a sharp deceleration.""

Pinterest Stock: Less Exposure To Ad Crunch?

On the positive side, Pinterest said its exposure to some of the most affected segments like travel, automotive, and restaurants ""has not been significant.""

As a result, Pinterest stock popped 12% in reaction.

Pinterest provides a website where users post photos, charts and other images covering a wide range of categories and interests, with visual search capabilities.

It reported monthly active users of about 367 million, in line with estimates.

The company held its initial public offering about one year ago, pricing shares at 19. Its record high is 36.83, reached on Aug. 22.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney has an outperform rating and price target on Pinterest stock of 27.

Facebook, Google Popped After Earnings

""We will be looking for color on whether ad revenue growth trends have stabilized, like Facebook and Alphabet,"" Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.

A common theme in the Facebook and Alphabet earnings report was that ad revenue came under significant pressure in March before showing signs of stability in April.

Alphabet stock is up about 10% since its earnings report. Facebook stock is up 8%.

Pinterest stock, since hitting a record low of 10.10 in mid-March, has more than doubled.

(AAPL) beat quarterly earnings estimates when it reported results after the closing bell on April 30. The stock held its quarterly pivot at $272.81 on April 22, setting the stage for a positive reaction to earnings. The upside potential is to its monthly risky level at $337.57.

The iconic maker of iPhones is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and beat earnings per share estimates for the 16th consecutive quarter. The stock is not cheap, as its P/E ratio is elevated at 23.82 with a puny dividend yield of 1.01%, according to Macrotrends.

Apple stock closed last week at $310.13, up 5.6% year to date and in bull market territory at 45.9% above its March 23 low of $212.61. The stock is 5.4% below its all-time intraday high of $327.85 set on Jan. 29.

The daily chart for Apple

Refinitiv XENITH

The daily chart for Apple shows that the stock has been above a golden cross since May 9, 2019, when the 50-day simple moving average rose above the 200-day simple moving average to indicate that higher prices would follow. The stock then traded below its 200-day simple moving average between May 10 and June 7 as a buying opportunity. This signal followed the stock to its all-time intraday high of $327.85 set on Jan. 29.

The stock gapped below its 50-day simple moving average at $305.74 on Feb. 24 and tested its semiannual value level at $262.02 on Feb. 28. After a solid rebound, Apple stock failed to hold $262.02 on March 13. The annual value level at $253.68 also failed to hold on March 17. The 200-day simple moving average failed at $248.61 on March 20, and the March 23 low was $212.61.

The rebound captured the 200-day simple moving average at $251.36 and the annual pivot at $253.68 on April 6. The semiannual pivot at $262.02 was vaulted on April 8, and the quarterly pivot at $272.81 was a magnet between April 13 and April 21. The stock popped above the 50-day simple moving average at $274.93 on April 23, setting the stage for the positive earnings report released on April 30.

The weekly chart for Apple

Refinitiv XENITH

The weekly chart for Apple is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $283.25. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or reversion to the mean, at $183.60. Notice how tests of this moving average provided buying opportunities.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 57.36 last week, up from 50.19 on May 1. At the January high, this reading was 94.00, well above the 90.00 threshold putting the stock in an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation. The bubble popped to the March 23 low. At the January 2019 low, this reading was below 10.00, indicating that the stock was technically ""too cheap to ignore.""

Trading strategy: Buy Apple shares on weakness to the quarterly, semiannual, and annual value levels at $272.81, $262.02, and $253.68, respectively. Sell shares on strength to the monthly risky level at $337.57.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.

The second quarter 2020 level was established based upon the March 31 close, and the monthly level for May was established based upon the April 30 close. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week, and new quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year, while annual levels remain in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered ""too cheap to ignore,"" which is typically followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months."

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-users-excellent-value-550-000559452.html,FB,2020-05-09T00:05:59+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. users asked a judge to approve a $550 million settlement in their class-action lawsuit that claimed the social-media giant illegally gathered biometric data through a photo-tagging tool.

The class members will get from $150 to $300, or between 15% and 30% of the possible recovery on an individual claim, according to their lawyers. The settlement provides “excellent value” and “dwarfs every previous settlement” in a U.S. consumer privacy class-action suit, the lawyers said in a filing Friday.

The users’ endorsement of the settlement comes as U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco expressed skepticism over the recovery amounts given that the Illinois privacy law, which the company was accused of infringing, sets a “benchmark” of $1,000 to $5,000 for damages arising from privacy violations.

“If you’re not going to hit those, I need a good explanation for why the discount has been made, particularly if the discount gets to be steep,” he said at a February hearing.

The users agreed to the reduced damages because they haven’t suffered any economic loss and didn’t seek a multibillion-dollar settlement, their lawyers said. Facebook could have also asked the court to reduce damages after a potential trial, according to the lawyers.

“A verdict for the class here might lead to a damages award of several billions of dollars,” the lawyers said. “Facebook is surely one of the few companies who could absorb such a judgment, but it could make a persuasive case that such an award is disproportionate to any privacy harm caused by the Tag Suggestions or Face Recognition tool.”

Facebook users can “tag” others in a photo posted on the social network. Facebook then creates a link to that person’s profile. Facebook’s photo tag suggestions come from collecting facial recognition data from other photos.

The company agreed to turn off the facial recognition feature for class members and delete existing user biometric information unless they consent to turn on the feature within 180 days after the settlement is finalized, the lawyers said.

The users’ lawyers also sought $981,000, and additional expenses billed during the settlement negotiations, as attorneys’ fees. “There is no ‘clear sailing’ provision, and Facebook may challenge the fee and expense request if it desires,” the lawyers said.

Facebook proposed the deal in January in an attempt to avert a trial and resolve the privacy dispute.

By Lewis Krauskopf

May 8 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes jumped on Friday and logged solid gains for the week after data on historic job losses due to the coronavirus crisis showed they were slightly fewer than feared.

All 11 S&P 500 sectors were positive, led by the beaten-up energy group, which gained 4.3%.

A 2.4% gain in Apple shares also lifted the indexes after the iPhone maker said it will reopen a handful of U.S. stores starting next week.

The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the Labor Department reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls diving by 22 million, but the decline still marked the steepest plunge since the Great Depression.

“It’s tough to call the jobs report, which is what everybody was waiting for, anything but a complete calamity, but relative to expectations you can see some silver linings in there,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, pointing to the large number of temporary layoffs.

“Except for the initial panic in the month of March, in general the markets are ignoring economic data for the most part and are looking more at data related to COVID-19,” Nick said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 455.43 points, or 1.91%, to 24,331.32, the S&P 500 gained 48.61 points, or 1.69%, to 2,929.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 141.66 points, or 1.58%, to 9,121.32.

The Nasdaq posted its fifth straight daily gain, its longest such streak since December 2019.

The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell 3.46 points to 27.98, its first close below 30 since Feb. 26.

Financial markets on Thursday began pricing in a negative U.S. interest rate environment for the first time, as investors grappled with the economic consequences of the new coronavirus outbreak.

Stocks have staged a sharp rebound since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday erased its 2020 declines and turned positive for the year.

Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.

""People are watching closely to just see how this reopening process works,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services.

""On the margin, you are starting to hear businesses say that things are starting to look better from a depressed level.”

Optimism for markets was also fed by news that U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed their Phase 1 trade deal, with China saying they agreed to improve the atmosphere for its implementation.

In company news, Uber Technologies shares rose 6.0% after the company said ride service bookings slowly recovered in recent weeks.

Noble Energy shares gained 13.5% after the company said on Friday it would curtail oil production and further cut its capital spending to cope with a plunge in oil prices.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and three new lows.

About 10.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 11.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartphone-shipments-china-17-april-063700158.html,AAPL,2020-05-12T06:37:00+00:00,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Smartphone shipments from China's factories to vendors rose 17% in April compared to the same month a year ago, according to government data released on Tuesday.

The numbers suggest an early domestic rebound for smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Huawei Technolgies [HWT.UL] and a potential return to normalcy in China for the broader consumer hardware market in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.

Phone makers shipped 40.8 million handsets in April, up from 34.8 million in April 2019, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think tank.

For the first time in years, the organisation did not reveal the percentage of Android devices shipped, a key metric that gave insight into how many smartphones Apple sold in China each month.

Private research firms tracking the smartphone sector such as Canalys, IDC and Counterpoint Research all reported that in the first quarter shipments of Apple devices in China declined in the low single digits.

Rival Huawei managed to keep shipments relatively flat in the quarter while Chinese Android players Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi Corp bore the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak with shipment volumes decreasing by double-digit percentages, according to the research groups.

Apple and its rival smartphone brands do not publicly release regional shipments.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/vimeos-video-services-have-been-popular-during-pandemic-but-problems-elsewhere-for-iac-2020-05-06?siteid=yhoof2,GOOG,2020-05-06T00:00:00,"The COVID-19 outbreak has helped accelerate revenue growth for IAC/InterActiveCorp.’s Vimeo video-production unit, but some of the media company’s other businesses have been hit harder by the pandemic.

IAC IAC, -1.02% on Wednesday wrote off $233.4 million in goodwill and intangible impairment charges for its applications segment, “driven by the impact of COVID-19.” That led to a net loss of $211 million, or $2.49 a share, for the first quarter, after the company reported a net profit of $88.7 million, or 91 cents, in the year-earlier period. IAC’s revenue for the quarter grew to $1.23 billion from $1.11 billion, while analysts expected $1.2 billion.

Chief Financial Officer Glenn Schiffman was upbeat about business trends in a phone interview with MarketWatch, saying that “offline to online conversation will accelerate” during and coming out of the crisis, with IAC positioned to benefit from that shift. Schiffman called Vimeo “the star of the show,” as revenue grew to $57 million, up 31% from $43.6 million generated a year earlier.

“Using video to communicate with employees, with customers, and with anyone is needed more than ever” during the COVID-19 crisis, Schiffman said.

IAC is a conglomeration of websites and other online services, and has a majority economic interest in Match Group Inc. MTCH, -2.65% and ANGI Homeservices Inc. ANGI, +7.37% Match reported earnings Tuesday afternoon and said first-quarter revenue increased 17% to $544.6 million from $464.6 million, though year-over-year revenue growth slowed to 9% in April. IAC and Match still expect Match’s full separation from IAC to occur later this quarter.

ANGI saw consumer activity on its platform drop by 50% the day after the National Basketball Association announced the suspension of its season due to COVID-19, ANGI CEO Brandon Ridenour told MarketWatch. Trends worsened after that, but ANGI began to see demand recover even as lockdowns became more widespread, as home-services workers were classified as essential workers.

Revenue for ANGI climbed 13% to $343.6 million in the first quarter, and while it was down 2% in April, Ridenour said in an interview that the business seems to be seeing a V-shaped rebound. Throughout the course of April, ANGI saw “a significant recovery in consumer demand, particularly in the U.S.,” he said.

Ridenour said that about two-thirds of the home services that ANGI provides are for non-discretionary services. The company has seen the non-discretionary segment “recover and stay relatively strong.” People are also doing outdoor work that is discretionary, but there’s still pressure in indoor discretionary categories like home cleaning.

“The business to some degree benefits from depressed consumer demand because service providers need our help finding customers more than they would otherwise,” he said.

Revenue for Dotdash, which includes media brands like Investopedia and Brides, rose 30% to $44.1 million in the first quarter, but growth decelerated to 22% in April due to pressure from display advertising. Performance marketing revenue accelerated to 115% in April from 96% in March.

Schiffman said that Dotdash was “one of few publishers that grew in the first quarter and April” even as “the rest of the year will clearly be more challenging for that business.”

Applications revenue declined 27% to $104.1 million driven by challenges in desktop businesses, which include a variety of free desktop applications that IAC monetizes by powering users’ search queries in a partnership with Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -2.02% GOOG, -1.96% Google.

“The difference between revenue per user and cost to acquire is getting pretty thin hence the disappointing performance there,” Schiffman said of the desktop application business.

Revenue from Mosaic Group, which houses mobile applications, was up 2% in the month of March and up 5% in April.

Schiffman said that IAC is “hoping to go on the offensive as it relates to M&A” that targets assets that are either synergistic with existing businesses or that could potentially serve as entries into new categories.

Vimeo saw bookings climb 59% and accelerate in April, according to Schiffman.

The company recorded adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $163.3 million, below the $190.6 million it posted a year prior. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been predicting $159 million."

""Look for the helpers,"" Nancy Rogers would say. ""You will always find people who are helping."" This isn't advice from a Wall Street wizard, but it does apply to the stock market in this time of pandemic. Let's just say you can do well by investing in companies that are doing good, as these three examples demonstrate.

Gilead Sciences

Foster City, California-based Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is working to increase production of what could be a major pharmaceutical solution to COVID-19: its drug remdesivir. The company aims to produce 500,000 new doses by October, and more than a million by the end of 2020.

It already had a stockpile of 1.5 million doses — which it offered to the healthcare community for free. It has partnered with U.S. and international public health agencies in a truly global effort to fight the virus.

Remdesivir's secret weapon are components called nucleotide analogs that pose as viral building blocks. They make COVID-19 stop using the cells of the body as copying machines, hindering the virus from replicating and spreading. Basically, the coronavirus recognizes the nucleotide analogs as virus particles, but fails to notice the knife they are holding behind their backs.

In April, a global, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, yielded positive results. Patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received a placebo.

The news of potentially quicker recovery times for coronavirus patients means the 1.5 million doses of remdesivir Gilead has stockpiled and was thought sufficient for 140,000 10-day treatment courses would now be able to help significantly more people. But once those supplies run out, Gilead will likely turn new production of remdesivir into a lucrative revenue stream.

Gilead's stock price has climbed roughly 18% this year, lately primarily driven by remdesivir buzz. The worldwide clamoring for a treatment, and the promise remdesivir holds, have investors taking notice and the epidemiological community optimistic. There are other clinical trials of other drugs under way, but Gilead's experience with HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis drugs, plus the original development of remdesivir as an ebola treatment, has placed a lot of hope and trust in the company.

Alphabet

Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google is the go-to search engine for millions of internet browsers, and it's leveraging its technology to help keep the global community informed during the pandemic. It's also helping keep smaller businesses afloat during the economic downturn by pledging $800 million worth of aid. Skeptics would say that these are not direct donations — just making ad space available for free — but it can't hurt. If Main Street is suffering, Wall Street ain't feeling so hot, either.

Free advertising is great, but the big news comes from Google's partnership with rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and their ongoing development of COVID-19 contact tracing using its Android mobile operating system along with Apple's mobile iOS, by far the two most widely used operating systems for smartphones worldwide. These software tweaks will allow their mobile devices to use their Bluetooth receivers to measure and track the proximity of the devices in the community. Mobile apps monitored by government health agencies will allow users to self-report a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, which discreetly tags the device and sends an anonymous notification to any other devices with a record of being near it in the past.

The companies eased privacy concerns by explaining that the contact-tracking part of the system will be limited to short-range Bluetooth, not cellular data. In other words, it won't collect cellular location or GPS data from users, nor will it disclose any personal medical data. Other developers have proposed tracking systems, but the Google and Apple joint venture is the only one that has made privacy its No. 1 priority.

Google also offered the World Health Organization (WHO) and government agencies $250 million worth of ad space that to be used for public service announcements about the novel coronavirus and how to flatten the curve. In addition, it is offering $340 million in advertising credits to select small and medium businesses to help them survive.

Google/Alphabet stock has dropped about 9% from its all-time high as the coronavirus lockdown dampens the global economy but there have been signs of recovery for this blue chipper -- it fell as much as 30% by late March before beginning a slow but steady climb back upward.

Google/Alphabet also has the financial health to weather pandemic-induced economic turmoil, thanks to its balance sheet. As reported in its Q1 2020 earnings call April 28, it had $119.6 billion in cash and short-term investments in its pocket, against $3.9 billion in long-term debt.

Novavax

Epidemiologists and healthcare experts say the only way out of the COVID-19 pandemic is the development of a vaccine against the disease. Several biotechnology companies are in the race (see Gilead Sciences above), and another to keep an eye on is Gaithersburg, Md.-based Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX).

The company describes itself as ""a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to delivering novel products to prevent a broad range of infectious diseases."" It was very active in research on antiviral vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that attacks the very young and very old, as well as seasonal influenza and Ebola. On April 8, Novavax announced that it had been identified as a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The company uses a proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology. Most vaccines use whole dead or weakened germs to prepare the body to fight off a real infection — relatively slow to manufacture, and not effective in some patients. Newer vaccine approaches have tried using smaller components of the targeted germs, or just plain DNA from those germs. But these often fail to trigger a strong or lasting immune response, and they can break down quickly inside the body. Nanoparticles aim to shield those smaller payloads so they can more effectively reach their targets and stick around to raise the maximum alarm in the body's immune system.

This same technology could be an effective weapon against COVID-19. Phase 1 trials of Novavax's experimental vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, designed to assess its safety in human subjects, could begin as soon as mid-May in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia.

Novavax says the results for that first step could come in as early as July, based on its 35-day schedule for the trial. Bear in mind that if this candidate succeeds in the first round of trials, it'll need to survive two additional and more demanding trials before it's cleared for widespread use.

Novavax is hardly alone in its efforts. As of May 8, U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) records show 783 COVID-19 ""interventional trials"" under way somewhere in the world, or in the initial processes of planning and/or recruiting patients. It's a mad sprint to the finish line, with millions of lives at stake.

So what about investment potential? Well, Novavax stock has gained more than 300% since the beginning of 2020. The Wall Street bulls have taken notice, with some predicting it will grow past its current $1 billion market cap.

Investors would be wise to shy away from one-trick ponies, especially in the hypercompetitive and volatile pharmaceutical space. But Novavax seems to have a far broader stable. A nanoparticle-based influenza vaccine called NanoFlu is currently completing late-stage clinical trials. If that treatment gets FDA approval — which looks highly likely, because thus far it's performed better than its rivals — it could earn between $550 million to around $1.7 billion. Novavax also has a promising anti-RSV virus drug, ResVax, that shows potential as well.

Won't you be my neighbor?

Sure, we all invest in equities to get a return, to make money. That's what the game and the Fool are all about. But the times we are living in demand a different outlook. I'm not saying to ditch your portfolio for the sake of sentimentality — but —consider supporting companies that have joined the fight. We are all in this together, after all, and our success can be mutual."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [3]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope you're staying safe and well. Today, Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple retail powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we've ever operated our business, we're proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.

But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January, and I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do tells an important story about Apple's great durability as a business and the enduring importance of our products in our customers' lives. It also speaks to Apple's unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.

Story continues

Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business, in introducing powerful new products and in meeting our customers' needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work.

Let's look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world. While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, Macbook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the front lines.

In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV. And Services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users rely on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.

In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepared to deliver our first ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly 2 million times, and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies spread the -- reduce the spread of the virus with user privacy and security central to the design.

We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to give back where it's needed most. We've made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support Global Citizen as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food and security as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2:1 match for employee donations, Apple's contributions to the global response are significant, diverse and a great source of pride for the whole team.

We're also doing what we can to help our employees, their families and, by extension, their communities stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends, of course, to our retail employees. They are Apple's face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business, and we're compensating them normally despite store closures. During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work, and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.

At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland; and Puerto Rico; 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles; and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever.

Since early March, we've seen unprecedented demand for our Pro apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home, and to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.

And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on noninvasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and health care provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals, such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.

Now when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it. As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion, and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had 3 very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple's performance during the first 5 weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations.

In the next 5 weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.

Given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value.

Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand-new way. Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring, large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our long-standing goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020.

We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strength, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever. Major investments, including our 5-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States, are moving forward full speed ahead. It's in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We've always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation, and that's our strategy today.

And so while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.

With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luca Maestri, Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP [4]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. But we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.

Total revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%. After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last 3 weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.

Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I'll provide more details on this later.

Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings, a mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier.

Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discrete items. Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share were $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago.

Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $29 billion declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we've been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow.

Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines. On the demand side, after a very strong first 5 weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next 5 weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last 3 weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.

While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.

Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion. We had strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video, cloud services and our App Store Search Ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for Apple Care. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth. As Tim mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue during 2020.

App Store revenue grew by strong double digits thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services both set all-time revenue records and Apple Care set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all 3 of these services were up strong double digits.

Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.

Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double-digit performance across all 5 geographic segments. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we're very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach at over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.

Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion. iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand-new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We're very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products.

Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.

In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We've created content to assist our customers in this transition, including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPads and Macs and security. We have also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees, such as IBM and SAP, have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment. And we've seen countless examples of new projects and remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton, for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight so their team could work remotely.

In essential sectors such as grocery and financial services, we're seeing organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world like Trader Joe's, Woolworths, Lawson, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments, and a store shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic.

In banking, where safety and security is a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.

Let me now turn to our cash position. First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion, and as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.

Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we're facing.

From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response even during these extreme circumstances.

On iPhone and Wearables, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter. On iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter. On Services, we are seeing 2 distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, Music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity due to the lockdowns around the world, services like Apple Care and advertising have been impacted. Apple Care is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.

For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift towards Services.

With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a 5-year period.

We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.

Finally and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term as we've always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business, and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

Questions and Answers

Operator [1]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shannon Siemsen Cross, Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst [2]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment and geographic basis what you're seeing in the various regions that you're selling in and what you're hearing from your customers. And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [3]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, Shannon. If you look at -- I'll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February toward the second half of February, we began to open stores. We opened them on a staggered basis. That took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. And if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so that's China.

If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call, that the next 5 weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about.

The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work from home began. For those 2-, 3-week period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we've seen an uptick across -- really across the board. It's not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products. A part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.

In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter. And that's customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. And so complex answer to your question but that's what we're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shannon Siemsen Cross, Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst [4]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter but didn't really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I'm curious how you're thinking about your spending in OpEx given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luca Maestri, Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP [5]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Well, Shannon, as we said, we manage the company for the long term, right? So we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development, so we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We're very excited about what we have in store, and so we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment, and so we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. We -- as you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel, and obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us. And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [6]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will be from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wamsi Mohan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [7]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we're all very appreciative of Apple's contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [8]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you very much for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wamsi Mohan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [9]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, it's been great. Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing, and you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [10]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, we're continuing to operate. And so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and the MacBook Air. And so business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so we're continuing to work. Everybody is getting used to the work at home. In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive. In some other areas, they're not as productive, and so it's mixed depending upon what the roles are. But as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got. They are even more important in these times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wamsi Mohan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [11]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that? And -- or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [12]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We're working on doing that for other products as well, and you'll see something on that shortly. So we're very focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down.

In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But as you know, having access to the Card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom, and that is not using our balance sheet. It's -- but we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the Card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [13]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will come from Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kathryn Lynn Huberty, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst [14]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer-term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I'm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I'm sure there's even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [15]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work. And it's pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously, I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely, and so I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that's probably also true about working remotely on -- in some areas and in some jobs. And so I think we have significant solutions and products for those -- for all of those groups.

On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we're looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we've viewed that, that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so you will see us continue on that. I wouldn't say that the health door opened wider. I would say it was already opened fairly wide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kathryn Lynn Huberty, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst [16]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. And then as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion? And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luca Maestri, Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP [17]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years, and it's not changing now. Keep in mind here, we're talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our Board, right? So it's the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90 billion.

And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that, that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So nothing really has changed there.

And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We've been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We're always looking for ways to accelerate our product road maps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the Services side. So we will continue to do that. And so also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [18]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst [19]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2 as well. I guess, first off, on the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [20]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It's not unusual that we reduce in Q2, and in fact, if you look back on -- generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories. During the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That's a seasonal thing. And I believe -- sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position, so you could conclude from that, that we were within a target range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst [21]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's really helpful. And could I just follow up? Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about Apple's manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months. How do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [22]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. As you know, our supply chain is global and so our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States. We have final assembly in China as well. I think you'd have to conclude or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it's durable and resilient. And so I feel good about where we are. That said, we're always looking at tweaks, and it's just not something we talk about because we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [23]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We'll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kanghui Ong, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [24]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I want to focus the question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter in spite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see launch behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that's sustained? Or at some point, does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luca Maestri, Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP [25]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically don't give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I've said, as we look into the June quarter, we see 2 distinct trends in our Services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.

Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are 2 businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is Apple Care. Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures, not only our retail stores but also our partners' points of sale. And obviously, they reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures, right? And we do expect Apple Care to be affected during the June quarter.

The other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So these are 2 things that, during the June quarter, will create a headwind for the Services business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kanghui Ong, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [26]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. Appreciate that. My second question comes about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. So far through April, have you seen increased perhaps downticks across your product line? So for example, somebody might have a shift maybe towards the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through rest of '20?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [27]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't seen what you're asking, no. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology or coming over from Android. And so those are the 2 principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down as you're talking about it. We've also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this, and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that's obviously our top-of-the-line iPad. And so I'm not seeing what you're alluding to at least at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [28]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will be from JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst [29]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So if I can just start with a question on kind of what you're seeing in China, you mentioned kind of the pickup in activity. But is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what you're seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [30]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter, and I'll speak about Mainland China because I think that's the source of your question, we saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then in March, as stores reopened, we -- the recovery began, and then we've seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see, but that's kind of what we've seen so far there.

To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, the -- it's pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter, and that's despite stores being closed for the 3-week period around the world ex China and then China was closed prior to that 3 weeks. And that's partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China but it was also other regions as well. So there is definitely a move. And whether that's a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far as I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst [31]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the lineup just given the lower price point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [32]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so we'll see how that plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. And so it's an unbelievable offer. It's, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And I think -- and it's faster than the fastest Android phones, and so it's an exceptional value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [33]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Christopher Caso, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [34]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point, what does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [35]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chris, we've always been about delivering the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It's great to bring it back. It was a beloved product, and so I wouldn't read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Christopher Caso, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [36]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. As a follow-up, the follow-up question is on commodity pricing, and I think you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect as you go through the year perhaps in this new environment and again, whether that turned into a tailwind or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy D. Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO & Director [37]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly, while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices, we expect to decline.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/google-parents-sidewalk-labs-pulls-plug-on-toronto-waterfront-quayside-project?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO,GOOG,2020-05-07T19:20:28+00:00,"Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report subsidiary Sidewalk Labs said Thursday that it is abandoning its plan to transform a portion of Toronto's waterfront district into a high tech utopia due to ""economic uncertainty"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Sidewalk Labs CEO Daniel Doctoroff made the announcement about the project, which would have created a high-tech community on a mostly vacant area of an industrial waterfront location called Quayside.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet were up nearly 2% to $1,372.77

""For the last two-and-a-half years, we have been passionate about making Quayside happen,"" Doctoroff said in a blog post. ""But as unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed together with Waterfront Toronto to build a truly inclusive, sustainable community.""

Doctoroff, a former New York City deputy mayor, added that ""while we won’t be pursuing this particular project, the current health emergency makes us feel even more strongly about the importance of reimagining cities for the future.""

Sidewalk Labs had at times planned to spend $1.3 billion on mass timber housing, heated and illuminated sidewalks, and public Wi-Fi, as well as cameras and other sensors.

The project stirred up controversy, as opponents raised concerns over privacy, data ownership and whether the Quayside servers would be in the U.S. or Canada, according to the Toronto Star.

Waterfront Toronto, the nonprofit, government-appointed partner on the project, said in a statement that ""while this is not the outcome we had hoped for, Waterfront Toronto offers thanks and appreciation to Sidewalk Labs for its vision, effort, and the many commitments that both the company and its employees have made to the future of Toronto."""

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220,AAPL,2020-05-11T12:00:30+00:00,"Apple (AAPL) saw its shares surge during Wall Street's flight to quality names after the recent coronavirus stock market correction. Analysts hope the consumer electronics giant's financials will spring back quickly when the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. With Apple stock on the upswing, many investors are wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now.

X

Apple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II. Then it reinvented the PC in the 1980s with the Macintosh.

Co-founder Steve Jobs returned to run Apple in 1997 and oversaw a winning streak of innovations that included the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad and the App Store.

The biggest driver of Apple's modern success is the iPhone. The game-changing smartphone, which debuted in 2007, sparked years of massive growth and created a loyal base of customers willing to buy Apple services and accessories.

But iPhone sales have slowed as users hold on to their handsets for longer periods between upgrades. However, the company could be on the brink of a major upgrade cycle with its first 5G iPhones, due out this fall.

Apple Stock News: 5G iPhone Delay?

Apple usually releases its latest iPhones in September, but market uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic could delay the launch.

The Wall Street Journal reported April 27 that Apple is pushing back the production ramp for its iPhone 12 series phones, reported to be its first 5G smartphones, by about a month. The delay is the result of manufacturing interruptions in Asia and weakened global consumer demand from the coronavirus pandemic, the report said. Apple also is slashing the number of handsets it plans to produce in the second half of the year, the Journal said.

Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said the release timing for the iPhone 12 series is still up in the air. Apple is likely to release the new handsets between October and early December, rather than the usual mid- to late-September launch, he said. The lineup is likely to have both 4G and 5G handsets, Ives said.

On April 15, Apple introduced a lower-cost smartphone aimed at budget-conscious consumers and emerging markets. The second-generation iPhone SE starts at $399.

Apple Opportunities For Growth

With iPhone growth slowing, investors are wondering what the next big growth driver will be for Apple stock.

Lately, two businesses have given Apple's sales and profits a boost: services and wearables.

In the March quarter, Apple's services revenue rose nearly 17% to $13.35 billion. Services include App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.

Meanwhile, Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories unit saw sales jump 22.5% to $6.28 billion. This unit includes wearables like the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless earbuds and Beats headphones. It also contains the Apple HomePod wireless speaker and other miscellaneous gadgets.

Apple Earnings: Beat And No Guidance

On April 30, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company delivered better-than-expected March-quarter results but withheld guidance.

Apple earned $2.55 a share on sales of $58.31 billion in its fiscal second quarter ended March 28. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $54.54 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings rose 4% while sales inched 1% higher.

In the March quarter, iPhone sales fell 6.7% to $28.96 billion. Mac computer sales dropped 2.9% to $5.35 billion. And iPad tablet sales slid 10.3% to $4.37 billion. Growth in services and wearables helped offset those declines.

Apple did not issue guidance for the current quarter, citing market uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic. Wall Street had been predicting Apple earnings of $2.07 a share on sales of $51.54 billion for the June quarter. In the year-earlier quarter, Apple earnings were $2.18 a share on sales of $53.81 billion.

The results from the March and June quarters will be a stark contrast to the December quarter. In the holiday quarter, Apple earned $4.99 a share, up 19%, on sales of $91.8 billion, up 9%.

The next catalyst for Apple stock could be the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, beginning June 22. The event is being held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the conference, Apple executives will reveal software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and other devices.

Exclusive Apple Stock Ratings

During the bounce back from the lows of the coronavirus stock market crash, Apple stock has been outperforming the broader market.

AAPL stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93 out of 99. That puts it in the top 7% of stocks over the past 12 months. In a bullish sign, the stock's relative strength line is at a record high. The RS line, the blue line in the charts here, measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.

Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup tool. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Apple was the first company to reach a market value of over $1 trillion. Since it hit that milestone in August 2018, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have joined it in the trillion-dollar club, though Alphabet has since fallen out of the group.

AAPL Stock Technical Analysis

On April 29, Apple stock broke out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.

On Thursday, AAPL stock closed above the 5% chase zone of its recent breakout.

It ended the regular session Friday up 2.4% to 310.13.

Apple stock notched an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, before the coronavirus stock market correction.

Is Apple Stock A Buy Right Now?

Apple stock is not a buy right now. It is extended from its most recent buy point.

AAPL stock will need to form a proper base in the right market conditions before setting a new potential buy point.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dropbox-ceo-wants-to-organize-your-work-and-help-you-focus-134610951.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T13:46:10+00:00,"By his own admission, Dropbox co-founder and CEO Drew Houston has spent the past eight weeks or so of peak COVID-19 quarantine life more fully embracing the art of running and catching up on Netflix.

Well that and overseeing a nearly $10 billion market cap company that similar to other work-from-home tech outfits such as Slack and Zoom is experiencing a transformational moment in their relatively short histories. The importance of the time is not lost on Houston — who co-founded Dropbox in 2007 with Arash Ferdowsi —as he is pushing his team to develop new tools for users that cater even more to a future of working from home.

It’s a world where we will need greater insight into what co-workers are thinking, feeling and doing since we won’t be in the office (at all or not that much). This is the void the likes of Dropbox, Zoom, Slack and others will look to fill in an effort to get us all working collaboratively and efficiently.

“And so what we're thinking about is in our products, given that you lose that human connection, how do you recreate the experience of being together in the app? How do you make it so that you can see what's been going on on your team in a much more organized and focused way? Because a lot of the messaging tools are great. But if you leave your computer for a day and come back, you have to page through all these chats, transcripts and emails and try to piece together what's going on. So what if that were easier? So that's a lot of what we're focused on. From a product standpoint, how do we pull all this together and organize your work and help you focus,” Houston explains to Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Dropbox has already seen an uptick in business as a byproduct of the shift to working from home during the health crisis.

Trial subscriptions to Dropbox’s business and individual services have increased 40% and 25%, respectively, since mid-March. Active users for the company’s new desktop app have surged 60%. Heading into April, Dropbox saw a 20-fold spike in the use of its integration with video calling platform Zoom.

Paying users in the first quarter rose 2.1% sequentially to 14.6 million, ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 14.57 million. Average revenue per user increased to $126.30 from $121.04 a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margins improved to 16.1% from 10.1% last year.

‘Healthy balance of growth and profitability’

The solid start to the year brings Dropbox incrementally closer to the aggressive profit margin forecasts it put out in February. The company said at the time it expects operating margins to reach 28% to 30% by 2024, up from a prior forecast of 20% to 22%.

Worth noting is that those targets came prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that has businesses globally rethinking how they operate and signing up to different services from a Dropbox. Houston won’t say whether the targets— which surprised many on the Street at the time — are now conservative in the wake of COVID-19.

“Well, we've always been focused on delivering a healthy balance of growth and profitability. And when we felt that we had an opportunity to update our long-term model to reflect the inherent efficiency in the business. And then with given COVID we're heading into a pretty unpredictable background environment. So you know, we'll be watching everything closely,” Houston says.

Only time will tell. But Wall Street stays invested in the Dropbox story — 71% of the sell-side analysts who cover the company rate the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data. The average 12-month price target by the analyst community is $26, suggesting at least 24% upside from current levels.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-dividend-stocks-144841261.html,AAPL,2020-05-09T14:48:41+00:00,"Billionaire Ken Fisher is a well-known name on Wall Street, but for those who don’t know or recognize him, he is a money manager who runs Fisher Investments. Fisher Investments has over $80 billion in assets. In addition, Fisher is a popular author, with several of his books becoming New York Times bestsellers and a long-time Forbes columnist. Fisher’s investment approach involves buying unpopular stocks of good companies and hold them for long periods of time and enjoy the returns as companies gain popularity. In this article, we are going to explore some of Ken Fisher’s favorite dividend stocks.

Yesterday, we took a look into Ken Fisher's top 10 stocks picks at the height of the coronavirus market crash. All 10 of his top 10 stock picks outperformed the market this year (read the second article which links to the first article). During the first quarter Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks delivered an average loss of only 6%, vs. a loss of nearly 20% for the S&P 500 Index. That return was even better than the average return of top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of 6.9% during the first quarter. As you can guess top hedge fund stock picks is a very fertile area to look for good stocks to beat the market.

Ken Fisher - FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT More

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years.

We have to warn you that Ken Fisher isn't a huge fan of traditional dividend investing. Ken Fisher pointed it out himself in his “The Little Book of Market Myths“, when he mentioned the fact that Lehman Brothers paid a dividend in August 2008, just weeks before it went under. In the chapter about high-yield dividend stocks, Fisher says:

“High-dividend stocks aren’t permanently better and don’t have materially different expected volatility or return characteristics over time. As important: Dividends aren’t guaranteed. Firms that pay them can and do and will cut the dividend. Or they may kill it altogether!”

Instead, Fisher suggests to engage in what he calls “homegrown dividends”, which involves selling a portion of shares in order to generate cash. In the end, Fisher says that a well-diversified portfolio is bound to have some dividend-paying stocks, but we shouldn’t focus on them and, instead pay more attention to the overall long-term return rather than just the dividend yield.

Having said that, let’s now take a closer look at Fisher’s stock picks.

The biggest dividend stock position in Fisher is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple Inc shares yield a little over 1% in terms of annual dividends. Fisher had nearly $3.6 billion invested in this $1.34 trillion company. Apple Inc. shares returned 22.3% so far in the second quarter. We are certain that Fisher didn't invest in Apple shares for the puny dividend of 1%. We singled out this position to illustrate what Fisher means by ""homegrown dividend"" stocks.

We have to tell you that not everyone agrees with Ken Fisher about investing in quality stocks at this point in the market. In the following video you can watch why Bill Miller thinks it doesn’t make sense today to invest in quality stocks such Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and 6 other recession stocks that performed well so far (Bill Miller's hedge fund returned 120% in 2019).

https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-post-coronavirus-stock-market-rally-roku-trade-desk/?src=A00220,AAPL,2020-05-08T12:00:07+00:00,"Dow Jones futures rose solidly early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, ahead of a historically bad jobs report and with uncertainty surrounding Tesla (TSLA) and its Fremont, California plant. That follows a strong day for the post-coronavirus stock market with the Nasdaq turning positive for 2020.

X

Roku (ROKU), Insulet (PODD), Trade Desk (TTD), Inphi (IPHI), Qualys (QLYS) and Avalara (AVLR) all reported earnings late Thursday.

Roku stock, Trade Desk stock, Insulet stock, Qualys stock and Avalara stock cleared buy points intraday Thursday just before earnings. But four of these five ""can't-wait-for-earnings"" breakouts, while AVLR stock initially sank before moving slightly higher. The overall moves highlight that buying ahead of earnings is very risky.

Meanwhile, chip leader Inphi stock rose overnight. IPHI stock had closed well above its early-April breakout.

Several of these companies — including IPHI stock, TTD stock, QLYS stock and AVLR stock — have relative strength lines at or near record highs, a bullish sign. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line for Roku stock is not at a consolidation high, but is at a short-term peak.

Tesla Fremont Plant

Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly aims to restart the Fremont plant by Friday afternoon, according to an email to workers. The Fremont plant will resume with ""limited operations"" with about 30% of workers for a normal shift, according to the company. But will it?

The main Tesla manufacturing facility has been closed since March 23 due to a ""stay-at-home"" order from Alameda County. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday said he would allow manufacturing to resume in California, but noted that local rules take precedence. So far Alameda County and other Bay Area counties and San Francisco haven't signaled they're ready to lift local bans on nonessential businesses, which currently runs through May 31. Then again, Musk defied the local order in March, keeping the Tesla Fremont plant open for another week.

Meanwhile, the Tesla Shanghai plant has been shut down beyond an early May holiday period. There have been reports that the Shanghai plant is running out of pants sourced from the U.S., though Tesla denies that's the reason. The Tesla gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada, also closed down, supplies battery cells, while many other U.S. suppliers have gone dark

Tesla stock rose 1% in the premarket. TSLA stock is consolidating just below 800 following a recent breakout attempt that quickly failed.

Bring Your 'A' Game To Post-Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

Trade Desk stock, Qualys stock and Inphi stock boast 98 IBD Composite Ratings out of a best-possible 99. Tesla stock has a 97 Composite Rating, thanks to some recent profits and massive, whipsaw stock gains in the last several months. Avalara stock has a solid 91 Composite Rating, though it is not profitable. Insulet stock and Cloudflare stock have decent 81 Composite Ratings.

With so many stocks breaking out in the post-coronavirus market rally, investors should be focusing on A-quality names, with strong growth, institutional support and better chart patterns. Roku stock, which corrected 65% during the coronavirus market crash, has been a huge winner at times, but the money-losing stock is tremendously volatile.

Contrast that to profitable leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT), ServiceNow (NOW) and Apple (AAPL), which have corrected a relatively modest 31%, 34% and 35%, respectively. All three stocks have broken out over the last several sessions. Their RS lines are at record highs.

Microsoft stock and Apple stock are both trillion-dollar companies and members of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite. It doesn't get much more institutional than that.

Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock and Apple stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. MSFT stock and NOW stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

If you do buy more speculative names like Roku stock, keep them at a relatively small share of your portfolio.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 1.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 1.1%. During the post-coronavirus stock market rally, Dow Jones futures have been less prone to the whipsaw moves of the recent market crash. But big overnight moves are not uncommon, with Dow futures picking up steam Thursday morning, foreshadowing Thursday's strong market rally.

Remember that overnight action in Dow futures, Roku stock, Trade Desk stock and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

April Jobs Report

The April jobs report will loom large over Dow Jones futures Friday, morning, coming out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls plunged by 21.5 million, with unemployment soaring to 16.4%. But huge job losses will likely continue, at least in the short run. Hence the enormous pressure to reopen the economy, ready or not.

Why The Shelf Pattern Is The Perfect Pyramiding Tool In Growth Stocks

Roku Earnings

Roku earnings came in at an adjusted loss of 45 cents vs. a 9-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue grew 55% to $320.8 million. Wall Street had forecast a 45-cent loss on sales of $306.7 million.

While profitability is a long way off, the streaming platform leader is seeing booming use during the stay-at-home coronavirus shutdowns. Operating costs shot up 76%.

Roku stock fell 8% before Friday's open. On Thursday, Roku stock popped 7.8% to 137.50, clearing a 135.57 handle buy point as well as a downward-sloping trend line.

Trade Desk Earnings

Trade Desk earnings surged 84% to 90 cents a share, with revenue up 33% to $160.7 million. Analysts expected Trade Desk earnings of 38 cents on sales of $158.3 million

The maker of digital advertising tools didn't provide guidance due to the coronavirus.

Trade Desk stock retreated 8% in the premarket. TTD stock rose 3.3% Thursday to 322.50. Intraday, Trade Desk stock hit 327.35, briefly moving above a V-shaped cup-base buy point of 323.88, according to MarketSmith analysis.

Like Roku stock, Trade Desk stock is coming out of a deep base (58%). Unlike Roku stock, TTD stock is at a new high, so it doesn't have overhead resistance. But by running up so fast from the bottom, Trade Desk stock is vulnerable to a pullback.

Insulet Earnings

Insulet earnings turned out to be a 3-cent loss as revenue grew 24% to $198 million Analysts expected break-even Insulet earnings with sales at $190 million.

The insulin pump maker now sees 2020 revenue rising 15% in constant currency, at the low end of its February forecast for 15%-19% growth.

Insulet stock fell in extended trade, with a wide bid-and-ask spread. PODD stock rallied 4.2% to 215.15 on Thursday, breaking out from a 209.94 cup-with-handle buy point.

Insulet stock is one of a trio of diabetes products leaders. Dexcom (DXCM) has been the clear standout. Dexcom stock leapt 10% Thursday on news it'll join the S&P 500 index. DXCM is well extended. Tandem Diabetes stock rose nearly 3%, running toward a buy point in a cup base.

Livongo, which makes remote monitoring products for chronic diseases including diabetes, is also in the general field.

Qualys Earnings

Qualys earnings rose 33% to 65 cents a share. Revenue climbed 14.5% to $86.3 million. Wall Street expected Qualys earnings of 60 cents on sales of $85.8 million

The cybersecurity firm guided slightly higher on Q2 EPS but slightly lower for revenue.

Qualys stock plunged 8.4% overnight. QLYS stock popped 5.5% to 111.25 on Thursday, clearing a 110.99 alternative entry from a short consolidation. That was on top of a cup-base breakout with a 94.82 buy point.

Avalara Earnings

Avalara earnings came in at a 5-cent loss vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue rose 31% to $111.4 million. Analysts expected an 11-cent loss on $108.4 million in revenue.

The maker of tax compliance automation software, citing the coronavirus crisis, guided slightly lower on Q2 revenue and roughly in line for full-year revenue.

Avalara stock initially sold off after hours, but rallied to move slightly higher. AVLR stock rose 9.3% to 101.76 on Thursday, breaking out above a 97.06 cup-base entry.

Inphi Earnings

Inphi earnings leapt 88% to 62 cents a share as revenue surged 70% to $139.4 million. Analysts saw Inphi earnings at 57 cents on sales of $137.9 million.

The data-center chipmaker also guided higher for Q2 EPS and sales.

Inphi stock rose 11% before the open. IPHI stock climbed 2.75% to 98.97 on Thursday, near recent highs.

Inphi stock corrected 40% during the coronavirus market crash, but has roared back. Its RS line was already at new highs before Inphi stock broke out on April 3.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-names-first-members-oversight-171141358.html,FB,2020-05-06T17:11:41+00:00,"FILE PHOTO: Facebook symbol is seen on a motherboard in this picture illustration

By Elizabeth Culliford

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc's <FB.O> new content oversight board will include a former prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and several constitutional law experts and rights advocates among its first 20 members, the company announced on Wednesday.

The independent board, which some have dubbed Facebook's ""Supreme Court,"" will be able to overturn decisions by the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram.

Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues. They range from temporarily removing a famous Vietnam-era war photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack, to failing to combat hate speech in Myanmar against the Rohingya and other Muslims.

The oversight board will focus on a small slice of challenging content issues including hate speech and harassment and people's safety.

Facebook said the board's members have lived in 27 countries and speak at least 29 languages, though a quarter of the group and two of the four co-chairs are from the United States, where the company is headquartered.

The co-chairs, who selected the other members jointly with Facebook, are former U.S. federal circuit judge and religious freedom expert Michael McConnell, constitutional law expert Jamal Greene, Colombian attorney Catalina Botero-Marino and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

Among the initial cohort are: former European Court of Human Rights judge András Sajó, Internet Sans Frontières Executive Director Julie Owono, Yemeni activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman, former editor-in-chief of the Guardian Alan Rusbridger, and Pakistani digital rights advocate Nighat Dad.

Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, told Reuters in a Skype interview the board's composition was important but that its credibility would be earned over time.

""I don't expect people to say, 'Oh hallelujah, these are great people, this is going to be a great success' - there's no reason anyone should believe that this is going to be a great success until it really starts hearing difficult cases in the months and indeed years to come,"" he said.

The board will start work immediately and Clegg said it would begin hearing cases this summer.

The board, which will grow to about 40 members and which Facebook has pledged $130 million to fund for at least six years, will make public, binding decisions on controversial cases where users have exhausted Facebook's usual appeals process.

The company can also refer significant decisions to the board, including on ads or on Facebook groups. The board can make policy recommendations to Facebook based on case decisions, to which the company will publicly respond.

Initially, the board will focus on cases where content was removed and Facebook expects it to take on only ""dozens"" of cases to start, a small percentage of the thousands it expects will be brought to the board.

""We are not the internet police, don't think of us as sort of a fast-action group that's going to swoop in and deal with rapidly moving problems,"" co-chair McConnell said on a conference call.

The board's case decisions must be made and implemented within 90 days, though Facebook can ask for a 30-day review for exceptional cases.

""We're not working for Facebook, we're trying to pressure Facebook to improve its policies and its processes to better respect human rights. That's the job,"" board member and internet governance researcher Nicolas Suzor told Reuters. ""I'm not so naive that I think that that's going to be a very easy job.""

He said board members had differing views on freedom of expression and when it can legitimately be curtailed.

John Samples, vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, has praised Facebook's decision not to remove a doctored video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Sajó has cautioned against allowing the ""offended"" to have too much influence in the debate around online expression.

Some free speech and internet governance experts told Reuters they thought the board's first members were a diverse, impressive group, though some were concerned it was too heavy on U.S. members. Facebook said one reason for that was that some of its hardest decisions or appeals in recent years had begun in America.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/09/got-3000-invest-buy-these-3-warren-buffett-stocks.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,AMZN,2020-05-09T00:00:00,"During Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting last weekend, CEO Warren Buffett made the following pronouncement:

Stocks have an enormous advantage and ... if you bet on America, and sustain that position for decades, you're going to do better than, in my view far better than, owning Treasuries securities.

Since the legendary investor took the helm of Berkshire in 1965, it has generated compounded annual gains of more than 20%, and by the end of 2019, it had increased in value by a massive 2,744,062%. Given his track record, investors could do far worse than follow the example of the Oracle of Omaha.

In times like these, making sure that your emergency fund is topped off should be a high priority. But if you've done that and still have some free cash leftover that you don't expect to need for the next three to five years -- $3,000 for example, though any amount will do -- now's a good time to invest in strong businesses. And among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, I think these three, in particular, have plenty of room to run in the years to come.

1. Visa

If there's one industry that's a no-brainer when it comes to periods of economic uncertainty, it's probably payment processing. Even with consumers reining in their spending to get through the tough times, they still have essential purchases to make, and no company is better positioned to benefit from that spending than Visa (NYSE:V).

The payments leader accounted for 53% of U.S. credit card network purchase volume, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in payments processed in 2018 -- dwarfing its three largest rivals combined. Perhaps even more importantly, unlike several of its primary competitors, Visa doesn't lend money. That represents a huge advantage at a time when unemployment is clocking in at a staggering 14.7% and the risk of credit delinquency and default continues to ratchet higher.

Finally, the company still has a long road for growth ahead, particularly in international markets. Visa estimates that around the world, people still make about $21 trillion worth of purchases with cash each year, and there are nearly 2 billion consumers without payment accounts, giving the company a large, and potentially lucrative, market opportunity to tap for growth.

2. Apple

There's no denying that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In its fiscal second quarter, which ended March 28, the company eked out revenue gains of just 1% year over year, thanks to strength from its services and wearables segments. But iPhone sales -- the largest single contributor to Apple's top line -- slumped by 7%. To put that into context, revenue in its fiscal first quarter climbed 9%, while iPhone sales jumped 8%.

Yet all is not lost for Apple. In a somewhat prescient step, it recently reintroduced a lower-cost iPhone SE, a move it had been planning for some time. With a starting price of just $399, the device should appeal to budget-conscious smartphone shoppers who might otherwise have waited to upgrade.

Then there's Apple's services segment, where revenues rose 17% year over year to an all-time record last quarter, despite the coronavirus headwinds -- or perhaps aided by them. The success was broad-based, with record sales from the App Store, Apple Music, video, and cloud services, as well as across most countries. Clearly, the segment got a boost from consumers under stay-at-home orders.

The wearables, home, and accessories segment also had a record-setting quarter, with revenue up 23% year over year, led by strong demand for AirPods and the Apple Watch.

This stock is still selling at a discount to its pre-coronavirus levels, but once investors realize Apple isn't a company on the brink, that sale won't last long.

3. Amazon

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may not check all the boxes of the typical Buffett stock, the legendary investor's view on it is well-documented.

Amazon has ""far surpassed anything I would have dreamt could have been done. Because if I really felt it could have been done, I should have bought it,"" Buffett said back in 2018. ""I had no idea that it had the potential. I blew it.""

It's also worth noting that it wasn't Buffett who finally pulled the trigger on putting it into Berkshire's portfolio, but one of his top-level subordinates, likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.

After initially falling as the pandemic began to make its impact felt in the U.S., Amazon stock recovered those losses and kept rising, holding up far better than most stocks since mid-February. Year to date, it's now up by around 29%, while the S&P 500 is still down by around 9%. Amazon services, from e-commerce to streaming video, and from cloud computing to Twitch, have become indispensable to consumers and businesses alike during the pandemic.

The tech titan reported its first-quarter earnings last week, and the results were remarkable. Net sales climbed 26% to nearly $76 billion and the company generated $4 billion in operating profits, despite coronavirus-related headwinds. Amazon has a bold vision for adapting to these unprecedented conditions, and it plans to spend $4 billion in the coming quarter to reduce the danger of its employees contracting COVID-19 at work, or exposing customers to it. News of that massive outlay initially sent the stock downward, but it's classic Amazon to be looking far into the future.

E-commerce represented just 11% of the total retail sales in the U.S. and the trend continues to gain steam. The new customers and new spending Amazon has acquired during the pandemic will still be around long after the crisis recedes, with even more to come."

Consumers are shifting more of their purchases to e-commerce, telemedicine and digital healthcare are gaining wider acceptance, and viewers are turning to streaming video in greater numbers than ever before for their in-home entertainment.

Economic insecurity and uncertainty about the future is also accelerating another trend that was already gaining steam -- cord-cutting. That, combined with greater adoption of streaming services, may hasten the death of cable according to a recent survey.

Mounting evidence

The onset of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be accelerating the cord-cutting shift. In a survey of 2,600 people in the U.S., a whopping 64% of respondents said they have cut the cord, are planning to, or never subscribed to cable in the first place. To further highlight the issue, of those households that still have cable, 11% said they plan to cut the cord before the end of 2020.

The numbers were even starker among those between the ages of 18 and 34, with the total jumping to 74%. This group of consumers is highly prized by advertisers because they are at the stage where they are beginning to build brand loyalty and also due to their high disposable income. The survey was conducted by The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD).

""With only a quarter of young adults having any long-term interest in traditional cable TV, in a few years we won't be talking about linear or cable TV at all. It will all be online and streaming,"" said Brian Stempeck, chief strategy officer for The Trade Desk.

The survey also includes a cautionary tale for subscription-only streaming platforms. 35% of consumers said they would rather watch free streaming with advertising, or accept limited advertising if it means a cheaper subscription, compared to 31% who say they would rather pay a subscription in order to skip the advertising.

The growing trend of cord-cutting

AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), and Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) are the largest pay-TV operators in the U.S., and viewers are abandoning them in greater numbers than ever before.

In 2019, the biggest pay-TV providers lost more than 4.9 million customers overall, the largest single-year decline in cable TV history, according to Leichtman Research Group. This accelerated from losses of 2.87 million in 2018 and 1.49 million in 2017.

Those who ditch cable are increasingly adding streaming video subscriptions. Data released by The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) last year showed that the number of streaming video subscribers surpassed cable customers for the first time in 2019, so the writing is on the wall.

Not all viewing is created equal

The quarterly results of two companies help further illustrate the current environment that's accelerating the trend. When Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) released its first quarter report last week, the results were startling. The company added 15.8 new subscribers, up 23% year over year, and more the double the 7 million it previously forecast. In its more mature U.S. market, Netflix added 2.3 million additional subscribers, up 23% year over year, and growing fourfold sequentially.

The Trade Desk itself is a good barometer for the changes occurring in consumer viewing patterns. The company's technology uses high-speed computer programs and algorithms to best match ads with the right customer, but its growth has been spurred by new advertising channels. In 2019, revenue grew 39% year over year, clocking in at nearly 10 times the rate of the overall ad industry, but the growth in connected TV revenue -- which is largely tied to ad-supported streaming services -- grew 137% year over year.

The death of cable?

It's important to note that it will be years until cable as we know it is gone. That said, the paradigm shift that's occurring in consumer viewing preferences has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially shaving years of cable's ever-shortening lifespan."

With the proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices, apps have emerged as an integral part of the tech economy. Over five million apps are available for download via Apple (AAPL) iTunes app store, the Google Play Store, or Amazon (AMZN) in dozens of categories.

Some apps help people manage their finances, and some provide up-to-the-minute news of the world. Others act as a GPS, allow users to shop at their favorite stores from their phones, take pictures, send messages around the world, find somebody to date within a five-block radius, or find the best nearby bar or restaurant. Whatever you can imagine, there is probably an app for that.

Apps of all kinds have become ubiquitous, and the majority of mobile device owners use multiple apps daily. Some apps have become hugely popular, leading to success and wealth for the developers, bringing in millions or even billions of dollars. These success stories, however, are the exception, not the rule.

Key Takeaways Most app developers work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by.

Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019, though a huge majority of that revenue went to large tech companies.

While some do strike it rich, an average hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes.

The unfortunate truth is that most app developers will work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by in a world of ever-increasing competition and consumers with short attention spans.

Understanding Getting Rich Creating Apps

Some free apps generate revenue via in-app purchases or advertising, while others are purchased. The good news for both kinds of apps is that people use them a whole lot. ComScore's Global State of Mobile 2019 found that more than seven out of every eight minutes spent on mobile devices is app-related.

The bad news is that ComScore also found the majority of mobile device users download no new apps each month. There is, however, a small set of around 7% of smartphone users who download apps like crazy, accounting for nearly half of all monthly downloads.

Apps can be a huge source of profits. Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019. These days, there are tens of thousands of developers working independently, with start-ups, or with established companies to come up with the next big app.

The competition to develop a successful app is fierce, and there's no guarantee that even a great idea executed well will catch on and bring financial success. Even though some apps have made millionaires out of their creators, most app developers do not strike it rich, and the chances of making it big are depressingly small.

Successes

First, it is worth noting that the most popular apps—rated by unique visitors per month—are owned and operated by large technology firms like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).

There have been a few instances of small apps generating big success and making their creators exceedingly rich. Some apps have been snatched up by larger companies for huge sums of money, for example when Facebook bought Instagram, Onavo, and WhatsApp.

Square, the point of sale app, has a market cap of $32.9 billion as of mid-2020. Snapchat has a market cap of $26.15 billion. Uber and Lyft have caps of $54.6 billion and over $9.35 billion, respectively. Airbnb was worth over $38 billion at the end of 2019.

Challenges

While those valuations and sales numbers may seem encouraging, don't be fooled: the average app developer is unlikely to strike it rich. According to Forbes, the average app developer produces between three and five apps, each app bringing in an average revenue of $1,125 on Google's platform and $4,000 on Apple's.

A hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes. And that doesn't account for the money, time, and effort invested in creating those apps.

With those small revenue potentials, it is hard to build a team of developers and create advertising and marketing campaigns to increase recognition and drive downloads. There is also a huge amount of competition. For every category of app, there are numerous options to choose from, and making yours the one to gain traction can be hit or miss.

On top of all that, even with a hugely successful app, there is no guarantee that it will be able to produce a profit. It is increasingly difficult to monetize activities that many people have come to expect to be free—such as messaging, social networking, photo sharing, and cloud storage."

As the coronavirus sell-off and emerging rebound have shown in recent months, you want to make sure each of the ""three big rocks of CAN SLIM"" are in place before you invest. Following that one simple step will help you stay both profitable and protected.

In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.

To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:

As you review these examples, be sure to note how NFLX stock, NVDA stock, FB stock have also returned to their positions of stock market leadership after suffering damage to their charts in the coronavirus sell-off.

Best Stocks To Buy — And When To Buy Them

When looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.

Market Direction: The best time to buy stocks is when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market outlook is ""uptrend under pressure"" or ""market in correction,"" it's best to keep your powder dry and wait for a new rally to take hold. (Here's how to easily check current market conditions.)

So be sure to focus on stocks that fit that bill. (See the seven traits of winning stocks.) Chart Action: Bases are like launchpads that reignite a stock and lift it higher after it's taken a rest. If you stay patient and wait for a stock to form and break out of a chart pattern, you significantly reduce your risk and still leave significant potential upside. (Here's how to find stocks near potential buy points.)

So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (also called technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.

Chart Patterns: Cup With Handle

From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.

The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% to 30%.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with the first down week).

Handle: at least five days long (count starts with first down day).

Buy point: peak in the handle, plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).

The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.

Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.

On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.

Nvidia Breakout From Cup With Handle

When Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.

The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.

Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.

From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose 750% over the next 29 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.

Showing reslienced and resumed market leadership, NVDA stock has reboounded from a sell-off that began in October 2018 and is now back to trading near an all-time high.

Chart Patterns: Double Bottom

The double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.

Here's what to look for in a double bottom:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 40% or less.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with first down week).

Peak in middle of W: should form in the upper half of the base and should be below the left-side peak.

Undercut: the bottom of second leg down should be lower than the bottom of the first leg down.

Buy point: 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.

Facebook Breakout From Double Bottom

Like many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.

Chart Patterns: Flat Base

As the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.

Here are the key elements of a flat base:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% or less.

Base length: at least five weeks (starting with the first down week).

Buy point: the peak in the base (typically on the left side of the pattern), plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Netflix Breakout From Flat Base

Netflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.

After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.

While many businesses have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, there are quite a few companies managing extremely well during these trying times.

In a normal market, it might seem too good to be true for a stock to be both a safe investment and a growth opportunity. However, these times are far from normal, and investors can find plenty of stocks that fit both of these criteria. Even after recovering a little from March's lows, the S&P 500 is still down 11% since the start of the year. Over 30 million unemployment claims have been filed in the U.S. since March, with economists predicting an overall unemployment rate of 16.1% for April. The last time unemployment figures were that bad was during the Great Depression in the 1930s.

If you're looking for some investment ideas right now, here are four companies that have become, or still are, safe investments in this market while having significant growth potential in the near future.

1. Gilead Sciences

If you're following the news, you have likely heard about Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) by now. The healthcare company has quickly earned a reputation for being a hot coronavirus stock thanks to its former Ebola drug candidate, remdesivir, that's being repurposed as a COVID-19 treatment.

Remdesivir is one of the few antiviral treatments that have shown results in reducing potentially life-threatening respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Currently, the drug is undergoing four different clinical trials, including one phase 2 trial and two phase 3 trials in the U.S., alongside a separate clinical trial with the French health organization Inserm. Preliminary results from two earlier phase 3 trials from China were announced in April. While those results weren't all that impressive, a Gilead spokesperson said that the studies stopped too soon due to a lack of patients, and as such, aren't statistically meaningful enough to come to a conclusion. On May 1, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave remdesivir an emergency use authorization so it can be used to treat 'severe' COVID-19 patients.

While it's easy to get caught up in the remdesivir excitement, investors shouldn't forget that Gilead's core business has also been doing very well. Gilead's HIV business, which includes Truvada and Descovy (the only two HIV prevention pills approved by the FDA), has seen product sales come in at $16.4 billion for 2019. To put it into perspective, Gilead's HIV business accounts for over two-thirds of the company's total product revenue, which in 2019 came in at around $22.1 billion. Additionally, HIV sales have grown by a double-digit margin from last year as well, increasing by 12% from 2018 to 2019.

To top it off, Gilead boasts a 3.4% dividend yield. While there are other pharmaceutical companies with higher dividends, Gilead's yield is a nice bonus on top of everything else that's going for it.

2. Barrick Gold

While owning gold is traditionally seen as a good place to store your wealth in trying economic times, owning shares of gold mining stocks is an excellent alternative.

One of the world's leading gold miners is Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). As with most other gold miners, higher gold prices are boosting Barrick's profit margins. With the precious metal now trading above $1,700 per ounce -- levels not seen since 2013 -- now is the perfect time for gold miners to report record revenues. If anything, prices could continue to soar in the months and years to come as the aftereffects of the pandemic linger.

While gold has some industrial applications, as well as being a major component in jewelry, a significant chunk of gold demand comes from investors looking to buy the metal as a way to protect their wealth during economic downturns. As such, gold prices tend to be inversely correlated to the state of the broader economy. Many Wall Street analysts, including Bank of America's Lukman Otunuga, have predicted that gold prices could soar to as high as $3,000 per ounce in light of this pandemic.

Although analysts have made bullish predictions about gold before that haven't panned out, even if prices stay around this level, gold miners will be quite happy. Barrick's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) -- a crucial metric used in the gold industry that determines the cost of producing an ounce of gold -- was $923 in Q4 2019. This is already a solid improvement from the previous quarter's $984 AISC, although the company still has some room for improvement, especially compared to the $806 AISC average reported for the full-year of 2018. However, in the grand scheme of things, if gold prices remain near $1,700 per ounce, that would leave a very nice profit margin for Barrick considering its AISC.

Barrick has been paying off its debt at an impressive rate. As of Q4 2019, the company's debt is $2.2 billion, a 47% decrease from Q4 2018's debt levels. This debt level is the company's lowest since 2007.

Perhaps the only problem for Barrick is its mediocre dividend yield, coming in at just 1.1%. But gold miners, in general, aren't known for their impressive dividends, so I wouldn't consider it a detriment to a company that otherwise has significant growth prospects.

3. Teladoc

Before this pandemic, Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) was considered an interesting albeit niche company in the healthcare market. However, with telehealth demand skyrocketing due to COVID-19, Teladoc is in the best position it's ever seen.

As the leading telehealth provider on the market, Teladoc has reported a drastic increase in new visits and customers over the past couple of months. The company recently said its daily appointments doubled to 20,000 per day. Industry analysts predicted that the total number of telehealth appointments conducted around the world could hit a record 1 billion by the end of the year.

The big caveat is that Teladoc is not profitable. While this isn't uncommon for tech-related companies, this new influx of patients could very well be what tips the company over into finally being in the black. Looking at Teladoc's Q1 2020 financial results it reported April 29, the company reported total revenues of $180.1 million, a 41% growth rate from the first quarter of 2019. Net losses for the quarter came in at $29.6 million, which is relatively unchanged from the $30.2 million loss seen in the same quarter last year.

While Teladoc would have been an interesting buy for a high-growth, high-reward investor a year ago, this pandemic has opened the door for further growth possibilities that no one would have guessed last year. As such, it's not surprising that Teladoc has more than doubled since the start of 2020, with more growth still likely to come on the horizon.

4. Netflix

Now that people are forced to stay at home and find new ways to entertain themselves, it should come to no-one's surprise that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has enjoyed a surge in customers.

Just recently, the company reported an impressive 15.8 million increase in users, more than double what it had originally predicted earlier this year. While some growth was expected during the quarantine, this increase was well above what many anticipated.

Other financial metrics, like Netflix's operating income, has more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, coming in at $958 million in Q1 2020 compared to Q1 2019's $459 million. Additionally, revenue growth is still quite strong, with this recent quarter seeing a 27.6% increase in revenue over last year.

Although Netflix said this growth is likely a one-time phenomenon and that shareholders shouldn't expect similar quarterly increases in new subscriptions going forward, it's still good news for the company nonetheless. Management also said this pandemic won't impact 2020's content production, with most of its lineup for the year having already been finished. Other projects, such as Netflix's nearly 200 animation projects in post-production, are still moving ahead as key animators work remotely.

With movie theaters, parks, and other entertainment venues likely to be closed for the rest of this year, people are looking for other ways to spend their time. Whether folks are having to work from home, are unemployed, or are simply bored, demand for Netflix will undoubtedly stay strong as this pandemic rages on."

The new handle only appears on the daily chart, according to MarketSmith, so a buy point at 247.46 is also in play. Home Depot shares fell 1.6% Tuesday and is back in buy range. The buy range tops out at 235.54.

Earnings results are due out May 19 ahead of the stock market open. According to IBD data, the company is expected to earn $2.27 per share on sales of $27.3 billion.

Johnson & Johnson Stock

On April 23, Johnson & Johnson cleared a 154.60 buy point in a cup base. But after a recent losing streak, shares are more than 5% below the buy point. Shares fell 1.3% Tuesday.

On April 14, the company reported better-than-expected Q1 results, but trimmed its full-year outlook. The first quarter featured strong pharmaceutical and consumer health sales, but revenue from medical devices tumbled as patients put off procedures amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Microsoft Stock

Dow Jones stock leader Microsoft is in buy range past a cup-with-handle's 180.10 buy point amid Tuesday's 2.3% fall. The 5% buy area runs up to 189.11.

Shares also broke out on April 16 above a 175.10 correct buy point in a double bottom, according to MarketSmith chart analysis.

Microsoft is an IBD Leaderboard stock idea and an IBD Long-Term Leader.

Bullishly, the RS line hit a new high last week, indicating strong relative performance.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-absence-drag-lagging-asia-043225158.html,FB,2020-05-12T04:32:25+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. technology stocks are on their hottest winning streak of the year, yet those gains aren’t necessarily translating to the same boost for their peers in Asia.

The tech benchmark Nasdaq 100 Index, heavily skewed toward the so-called FAANG stocks -- Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- as well as top position Microsoft Corp., has now rallied for six straight days. It has rebounded 33% since a low in March as investors piled into technology and biotech shares seen as winners amid the social-distancing lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.

There’s no equivalent tech mainboard in Asia, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index the closest comparable. It’s up a comparatively weak 24% since mid-March, and the top stocks in the gauge, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., have lagged that gain. Tencent Holdings Ltd., the online gaming and social-media services giant that analysts expect will report Wednesday an 18% revenue increase amid the virus outbreak, isn’t part of that index.

While the top of the Nasdaq 100 enjoys a more diverse mix -- Google, Netflix and Facebook leveraging demand for online and social-media services from consumers stuck at home, alongside Amazon’s online delivery -- the Asia Pacific index is largely dominated by chipmakers TSMC and Samsung. They account for more than a third of the gauge.

The coronavirus pandemic has been a net negative for chipmaker stocks worldwide. Despite growth in data centers, they’ve been hit by concerns about lower end-market demand for new personal computers, smartphones and autos, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anand Srinivasan and Marina Girgis wrote in a May 1 note.

Tencent not being part of the Asia Pacific tech index is also hurting it. After falling less than its peers during the initial market downturn, the stock is up 14% for the year, climbing to a two-year high on Monday.

Global mobile game sales hit a record for the week ended May 3, according to Sensor Tower, with holidays in China and Japan also helping gains, BI’s Matthew Kanterman and Vey-Sern Ling wrote in a note Monday. “Growth should continue above the long-term market potential for the duration of the pandemic, likely through 2Q,” they said.

Tencent was also included as a “select stock pick” as internet, health-care and property sectors are among those to benefit from China’s upcoming National People’s Congress, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Pierre Lau wrote in a May 11 note.

Best Stocks To Buy And Watch In Coronavirus Stock Market

Companies like streaming pioneer Netflix and Zoom Video Communications (ZM) are on the list and certainly qualify as top stocks to watch as they benefit from social distancing and work-from-home trends in the coronavirus stock market. But they're by no means alone.

Here's an overview of some the best stocks to buy and watch as we look for the next crop of stock market winners to emerge.

Apple Stock

Apple broke out of a cup with handle at the end of April. The tech giant recovered from a sell-off that began in October 2018 and is now back near a new all-time high, with its relative strength line in new high ground. Apple topped analyst estimates for its March quarter when it reported on April 30.

Microsoft Stock

The cloud computing and software leader has rebounded from a sharp sell-off in tandem with the coronavirus crash. Microsoft stock has now cleared a 180.10 buy point, putting it just below a new all-time high. In a sign of market leadership, its relative strength is floating around a new high.

PayPal Stock

The peer-to-peer and online payments pioneer bolted higher Thursday after reporting earnings. PayPal stock is now extended past a 124.55 buy point. The Silicon Valley-based company was recently featured on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index.

Netflix Stock

The big shift to shutting down movie theaters has helped spur interest in at-home streaming services from Netflix and others. Netflix stock has benefited from that, with it now trading just below a new all-time high. In the last two quarters, the company has generated triple-digit earnings growth, including a 107% rise in Q1.

Facebook Stock

The social media giant is trying to close in on a 224.30 buy point. A breakout would lift Facebook stock to an all-time high. The company reported Q1 earnings on April 29, posting a 101% gain. Sales growth for the quarter slipped from 25% to 18%. To help customers cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, Facebook is working to enhance real-time video experiences and live game-streaming.

More Breakouts And Setups In Coronavirus Stock Market

A strengthening stock market rebound and the release of Q1 earnings has the potential to push several leading stocks to new heights.

ServiceNow (NOW), which has been featured on IBD Long-Term Leaders and several other lists, broke out on May 5, just after reporting 57% EPS and 33% quarterly sales growth. In the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds, 24 leading money managers invested $574 million in ServiceNow stock.

Nvidia (NVDA) is also among top stocks to watch. After going through a steep correction that began in October 2018, the chip designer and leading AI stock is now testing a new all-time high. Nvidia is also on the latest list of new buys by the best funds, with 37 institutional investors picking up $875 million in shares.

So as the rebound from the coronavirus stock market crash tries to gather steam, keep a close eye on where the best mutual funds are placing their bets. And be sure to stay focused on the ""three big rocks"" of CAN SLIM investing to help ensure that you're placing your own bets on the top prospects.

AAPL, -1.14% rose 1.1% in midday trading Monday toward the highest close in nearly three months, with investors who own the shares through the close set to receive a dividend payment.

That dividend is up 6.5% from the 77-cent dividend paid out in February.

AMC did respond to a request for comment.

The stock AMC, -3.75% shot up 30.0% to $5.32, the highest close since March 4. Trading volume spiked to 105.2 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 9.1 million shares. Amazon shares AMZN, -2.16% rose 1.2%.

The U.K.’s Daily Mail reported over the weekend, citing sources, that AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and e-commerce and cloud giant Amazon.com Inc., which also is the parent of Amazon Studios, have previously held talks. The report said it wasn’t clear if merger talks were still active, or will lead to a deal.

AMC, which is the parent of the AMC and Carmike theater chains in the U.S. and the Odeon Cinemas chain in the U.K., has been struggling since the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shutdowns of movie theaters across the globe. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime Video was recently ranked second, behind Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.97% among U.S. streaming consumers.

Analyst Eric Wold at B. Riley FBR said what may also be piquing Amazon’s interest in AMC beside just a cheaper price is the November 2019 announcement by the Justice Department’s antitrust division that it would open a review of the Paramount Consent Decrees in place since 1948 regarding a studio’s ownership of a theater chain.

“With Amazon not dependent on any other release windows beyond its own subscription service (other than to qualify for industry awards), we would view increased control over the theatrical window through the acquisition of a large exhibitor as providing Amazon both an incremental earnings stream from its own films and an attractive marketing vehicle to drive additional subscribers being exposed to the studio’s films—something that, we believe, other studios would be comfortable with them doing,” Wold wrote in a note to clients.

AMC’s market capitalization fell to a low of about $216 million last month before bouncing to $554.6 million as of Monday’s close. The market value was down from $751.9 million at the end of 2019, and from $1.44 billion a year ago.

Wold said he would be “surprised” if AMC shareholders would back an acquisition, which would likely be all cash, with the stock down near all-time lows.

The stock has more than doubled from the record closing low of $2.08 on April 13, but was still down 26.5% year to date and 61.5% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, Amazon’s stock has rallied 27.5% over the past year and the S&P 500 SPX, -2.05% , by comparison, has gained 1.7%.

The rally off last April’s low got a boost after the company said it had enough liquidity to withstand a suspension of operations into November. Also providing a bump, some states have allowed movies theaters to reopen this month, with social distancing.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-coronavirus-lockdowns-are-boosting-netflix-but-leaving-hulu-lagging-behind-142530951.html,AMZN,2020-05-09T14:25:30+00:00,"Streaming platforms are benefiting from coronavirus lockdown orders — and quarantined families may be contributing most to the boom.

Hub Entertainment Research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers during the month of April who watch at least one hour of TV per week, recently found that 94% of self-isolating families with children pay for at least one streaming subscription. Yet that number dips to 82% for those self-isolating without kids, and falls even further for those not self-isolating and with no children at home.

(Source: Hub Entertainment Research, data collected in April 2020) More

To put those numbers in perspective, out of all Hub’s respondents, 78% said they own at least one streaming platform in 2020, which is six percentage points higher than 2019’s results. It backs recent evidence that suggests stay-at-home measures are bolstering interest in streaming, which are then translating into subscription buys.

The data gets more interesting when Hub drilled down into exactly which platforms got the most benefit. Netflix (NFLX) — which just reported a big surge in subscribers — led the way amongst quarantined families with 83%, followed by Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) and Disney+ (DIS).

Meanwhile, Hulu lagged in popularity with just 41% — and tellingly, Apple’s (AAPL) nascent Plus service didn’t appear to make the cut.

(Source: Hub Entertainment Research, data collected in April 2020) More

“What our study shows is exactly where they’re turning to fill their newly found viewing time—primarily to streaming services that offer a combination of exclusive originals, family-friendly titles, and older shows that can provide a bit of nostalgic solace during this unprecedented and stressful time,” Peter Fondulas, principal at Hub and co-author of the study, said in a statement.

Netflix checks most of those boxes from strong originals like “Ozark” and “Stranger Things,” to more classic titles like “The Office” and “Gilmore Girls.”

Netflix originals from ""Ozark"" to ""Stranger Things"" are attracting consumers as stay-at-home mandates push viewers to streaming. More

One streamer that seems to be falling behind is Disney-owned Hulu. In a separate study conducted by 7Park Data, Hulu also struggled to match its competitors — with average household minutes dropping for the month of April despite stay-at-home restrictions.

Meanwhile, Netflix once again dominated the space, securing the most viewing minutes for the month with consumers spending 50% more time on the platform compared to January, according to 7Park.

But the competition will soon be heating up with HBO Max (T) entering the streaming wars at the end of May — and the platform is leaning on some serious star power to help drum up some buzz.

iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) - Get Report on Tuesday received a price-target lift from well-known Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, who believes the rollout of the iPhone 12 this fall should “start the road to recovery” for Apple.

In a note to clients, Ives raised his one-year price target on Apple to $350 from $335 on expectations that demand for the new phone, which is expected in October, will help propel the company forward following its pandemic-led rout that saw it shutter stores globally.

The 5G-enabled iPhone 12, which is expected to come in a more squared-off frame with more screen space and new features including a LIDAR-enabled camera, is “the light at the end of tunnel” for Apple, and should help propel sales in the final quarter of the year and into 2021.

“We have further confidence that the eye of the storm is in the rear-view mirror for Apple from both a demand and supply chain perspective,” Ives said, adding that he and his team see strong pent-up demand for consumers “currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity.”

“Currently we estimate that (around) 350 million of Apple's 925 million iPhones worldwide are in this upgrade window, as we model going forward in a more draconian scenario that minimal new smartphone activity takes place in the coming quarters,” Ives wrote.

What’s more, Ives also expects that pandemic-related supply chain issues that continue to affect both production and distribution of Apple’s iPhones, iPads, iMacs and MacBook computers and accessories should be straightened out by then.

Ives also noted Apple’s “Teflon-like services business,” which has been “robust despite the Covid storm.” He maintained his outperform rating on the stock.

Shares of Apple were up 0.84% at $317.65 in trading on Tuesday."

X

The post-coronavirus stock market rally has been powerful, in large part thanks to big-cap techs such as Apple stock and the four FANG internet giants. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are obvious coronavirus plays. Facebook stock and Google stock are seeing heavy usage, though ad spending is a concern. Apple stock delivered a surprise EPS gain, despite its exposure to coronavirus supply and demand issues.

Top Stocks To Buy And Watch

One way to find the best stocks is to look at their IBD Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

Netflix stock is at the top with a perfect 99 out of 99 Composite Rating. Amazon stock and Facebook stock both have 98 ratings. Alphabet stock has a 95 rating and Apple stock has a 90 rating.

Investors should be focusing on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher but it isn't the only metric investors should keep track of.

Apple stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Facebook stock, Google stock and AAPL stock are on SwingTrader.

Facebook Stock

Facebook is the FANG stock closest to being actionable as it forms a cup base with a 224.30 entry point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The FB stock base is 39% deep. Largely that's above what investors should typically be after. But it's not unusual following the huge stock market crash. Facebook stock edged up 0.5% to 212.35 on Friday, climbing 5% for the week.

The relative strength line for Facebook stock is already at new highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500.

On April 29, Facebook reported first-quarter earnings that were mostly in line with expectations. Monthly active users climbed 10% to 2.6 billion as the users logged on the social media site to stay connected amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the company also warned that the increased user activity wouldn't protect it from the pullback it's seeing in online advertising revenue.

Google Stock

The next FANG stock closest to being actionable is Google, which is forming a cup base and closing in on a 1,530.84 buy point. Google stock had fallen 34% from its high on March 23 as fears rose over the Covid-19 outbreak. But the RS line for GOOGL stock hit a new high Friday.

Google stock rose 1.1% to 1,384.34 on Friday, also up 5% for the week.

The parent of Google reported mixed Q1 results last month as advertising revenue from the travel, auto and retail sectors fell. But YouTube revenue rose 33% to $4.038 billion, while Google Cloud revenue surged 52%.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock is extended from either a 383.11 buy point or 393.62 entry. During the bear market, NFLX stock fell more than 26% from a 52-week high in early March.

The FANG stock reported mixed Q1 financial results but it added 15.77 million new subscribers, crushing the 8.2 million subscribers analysts expected. Users went wild for its ""Tiger King"" documentary series, making it the most-streamed show in America in April, according to data analytics firm Parrot Analytics. ""Ozark,"" now in its third season, and the fantasy series ""The Witcher"" have also been popular binge watches.

The coronavirus pandemic has simply accelerated the existing trend toward video on demand and away from traditional pay TV, Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a report.

Netflix stock pulled back after its Q1 results, falling back to the top of its base before reversing higher in bullish fashion. NFLX stock dipped 0.2% to 435.55 on Friday, up nearly 5%. Shares are in a mini-consolidation above the prior base. It's not enough yet to form a proper pattern. But a move above the 449.52 peak could offer another entry into Netflix stock.

Apple Stock

Apple stock hit an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, just before the coronavirus stock market correction. AAPL stock has broken out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35 and is now slightly extended. Apple stock could dip back into the buy zone or form another handle to offer a new entry point, but hasn't shown signs of that yet.

Apple stock rose 2.1% to 310.13 on Friday, capping a 7.3% weekly gain. The RS line for AAPL stock is at a new high.

Apple stock is No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products group.

The consumer electronics company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results in April as demand for services and wearable devices rose. But iPhone revenue fell 6.7% as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones.

Analysts say the pandemic could also delay the release of the iPhone 12, Apple's first expected 5G phone, from its projected September launch to between October and early December.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock broke out of a cup base on April 14 with a buy point of 2,186.05. AMZN stock is currently extended above buy range. Shares rose 0.5% to 2,379.61 on Friday, climbing 4.1% for the week after rebounding from their 21-day line. AMZN stock could offer a new entry if its clears its record high of 2,475. Like Netflix stock, Amazon's short consolidation is far too short to be a proper pattern.

On May 1, Amazon stock tumbled nearly 8% following earnings, after hitting a record high heading into results. Q1 revenue growth beat Wall Street expectations. But earnings fell short and profit guidance was light as the e-commerce giant spends $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, to keep customers and employees safe.

Orders are soaring as customers are forced to stay at home amid the Covid-19 crisis. Amazon said it recently completed previous plans to hire 100,000 workers and will hire an additional 75,000 workers to meet growing demand. Amazon Web Services also is seeing strong demand from the stay-at-home trend.

Slow and steady, day after day, but now prices are just a shade below their January and February highs, and there doesn't seem to be much overhead resistance. While some analysts might suggest a double-top pattern is possible, I think we'll see higher prices and not a downside reversal. Let's look closer.

In this daily bar chart of AAPL, below, we can see a bullish alignment of prices and indicators. AAPL is above the rising 50-day moving average line and above the rising 200-day moving average line. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows strength from early April as buyers have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved above the zero-line last month for an outright go-long signal.

In this first Point and Figure chart of AAPL, below, we can see the uptrend in price. AAPL is just a few ""boxes"" from a new high trade and breakout. The volume by price bars on the left side of the chart shows that there was not a lot of volume traded at the prices above $318.32 so we should not anticipate much in the way of selling resistance.

In this second Point and Figure chart of AAPL, below, we used weekly price data. Here the chart shows a possible price target of $424.

Bottom line strategy: Stay long shares of AAPL recommended in previous updates. Raise sell stops to $301. $350 and then $400-$424 are the price targets."

Shares are in a mini-consolidation above the prior base. It's not enough yet to form a proper pattern. But a move above the 449.52 peak could offer another entry into Netflix stock.

Apple Stock

Apple stock hit an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, just before the coronavirus stock market correction. AAPL stock has broken out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35 and is now slightly extended. Apple stock could dip back into the buy zone or form another handle to offer a new entry point, but hasn't shown signs of that yet.

Apple stock rose 2.1% to 310.13 on Friday, capping a 7.3% weekly gain. The RS line for AAPL stock is at a new high.

Apple stock is No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products group.

The consumer electronics company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results in April as demand for services and wearable devices rose. But iPhone revenue fell 6.7% as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones.

Analysts say the pandemic could also delay the release of the iPhone 12, Apple's first expected 5G phone, from its projected September launch to between October and early December.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock broke out of a cup base on April 14 with a buy point of 2,186.05. AMZN stock is currently extended above buy range. Shares rose 0.5% to 2,379.61 on Friday, climbing 4.1% for the week after rebounding from their 21-day line. AMZN stock could offer a new entry if its clears its record high of 2,475. Like Netflix stock, Amazon's short consolidation is far too short to be a proper pattern.

On May 1, Amazon stock tumbled nearly 8% following earnings, after hitting a record high heading into results. Q1 revenue growth beat Wall Street expectations. But earnings fell short and profit guidance was light as the e-commerce giant spends $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, to keep customers and employees safe.

Orders are soaring as customers are forced to stay at home amid the Covid-19 crisis. Amazon said it recently completed previous plans to hire 100,000 workers and will hire an additional 75,000 workers to meet growing demand. Amazon Web Services also is seeing strong demand from the stay-at-home trend.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-google-extend-home-end-042553354.html,FB,2020-05-08T06:46:46+00:00,"Google is allowing employees to work from home until the end of 2020.

Facebook and Google have said they will let employees continue working from home for the rest of the year.

The tech giants have announced plans to reopen their offices soon but are allowing more home working flexibility.

Google originally said it would keep its work from home policy until 1 June, but is extending it for seven more months.

Facebook said it would reopen its offices on 6 July as coronavirus lockdowns are gradually lifted.

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said that employees who need to return to the office will start being able to do so from July with enhanced safety measures in place.

But the majority of employees who can carry out their jobs from home will be able to do so until the end of the year, Mr Pichai added.

The announcement coincides with Facebook's as more companies start rolling out their back-to-work strategies.

""Facebook has taken the next step in its return to work philosophy. Today, we announced anyone who can do their work remotely can choose to do so through the end of the year,"" a spokesman said. ""As you can imagine this is an evolving situation as employees and their families make important decisions re: return to work.""

Facebook is still determining which employees will be asked to come in, the spokeswoman added.

The social media platform was among the first tech firms to ask its employees to begin working remotely. Facebook gave employees $1,000 (£807) bonuses for their work-from-home and childcare costs.

The trend for working from home may suit some companies while they redesign their office spaces to cater to new social distancing guidelines. Some employees are nervous about returning to work in the middle of a global pandemic."
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-charter-communications-could-be-in-same-exclusive-club-as-amazon-and-netflix-2020-05-01?siteid=yhoof2,NFLX,2020-05-01T00:00:00,"Charter Communications Inc. crushed broadband-subscriber estimates and showed improvement in its video-subscriber losses, fueling excitement about the company’s positioning both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.

The cable company added 563,000 residential internet customers in the March quarter, far above the 374,000 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting.

What’s more, estimates for that metric had already been “ratcheted up” after Charter CHTR, -1.72% issued an upbeat filing a few weeks back, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote, making the company’s beat more impressive in his view.

Charter shares are up about 3% in afternoon trading despite earnings and revenue that came up shy of the consensus view.

While Charter saw shed 70,000 residential video subscribers, those losses were an improvement over the 152,000 the company shed in the prior March quarter. Charter is “so far the ONLY company to show improving video performance,” LightShed Partners analyst Richard Greenfield said in a tweet.

Analysts don’t mind video subscriber losses too much as the video business weighs on margins for Charter and other cable operators.

“In the current quarter Charter will cross a major milestone as high (80+%) EBITDA-margin residential data revenue will replace low-margin (10-15%) PayTV revenue as the primary revenue source for the company,” wrote Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak, who rates the stock a buy and elevated his price target to a Street-high $700 from $625.

Wlodarczak called the company’s report “bulletproof.”

Moffett wrote that reduced reliance on video is the heart of his bullish view on Charter’s stock because growth in broadband average revenue per user (ARPU) should “accelerate” as customers shed their video plans and move away from bundled discounts. At the same time, Charter’s “non-programming costs” should drop along with video subscribers.

“All of that seems to be playing out according to script; indeed, the COVID crisis seems only to be accelerating this trend as churn falls and activity levels therefore decline,” wrote Moffett, who has a buy rating and $574 target price on th stock.

He suggested that Charter may have proven with its latest report that it belongs in the “exclusive” club of companies that could emerge “for whom the coronavirus is more opportunity than crisis,” especially as the demand for strong broadband connection grows.

While Charter’s stock is “widely held, and widely liked,” shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -2.16% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.14% , Facebook Inc. FB, -1.44% , and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.97% are too, and those companies are “viewed as long term structural winners,” Moffett said. “Today’s results make the case that Charter should perhaps be viewed the same way. Cable’s advantaged infrastructure will do more than just persevere through the crisis.”"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-hospitals-tech-apple-microsoft-google-181142961.html,AAPL,2020-05-12T18:11:42+00:00,"Dan Bisset was in a medically induced coma and on life support. The 48-year-old’s blood was being artificially oxygenated via a specialized machine, as he continued to battle the novel coronavirus, which kept him in strict isolation.

Unable to let his family members into the unit, personnel in the cardiac intensive care unit at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, P.A., provided Bisset’s sister, Lisa Harvey, with an iPad, allowing her and Bisset’s wife, Shannon, to FaceTime him.

“Even though my brother was still in the medically induced coma, the nurses and the doctors would take the iPad and position it for us to be able to see my brother, to be bedside by my brother,” said Harvey, who was able to communicate with him as his condition improved.

A similar scenario is playing out in hospitals across the country, with tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) working in tandem with healthcare systems to ensure COVID-19 patients can stay in touch with their family, and helping protect healthcare workers from being unnecessarily exposed to infected individuals.

“It’s gone well, I mean shockingly well,” Dr. Chris Kapsner, medical director at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, told Yahoo Finance.

Abbott Northwestern is among those hospitals using Microsoft’s Teams to let doctors remotely speak with patients in order to limit their exposure to the virus. According to the tech giant, healthcare providers have conducted more than 34 million meetings via the service in the past month. The company was unable to provide prior usage statistics for medical settings, as this is the first time it has released such metrics.

“My initial concern was that the providers wouldn’t like it, the patients wouldn’t like it, and the nurses wouldn’t like it. But I’d have to say, uniformly, everyone understands that this is an important tool,” Kapsner said. “It’s by no means perfect, but it has been an important tool to allow us to efficiently and safely see patients.”

Protecting providers and patients

Under normal circumstances, doctors and nurses freely move in and out of patient rooms to perform evaluations and consultations. But when dealing with the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, each additional person in a room with infected patients could become one more person who contracts the virus.

To address that, Kapsner said that nurses and primary doctors who need to physically be in a room with a patient will still do so, but specialists and consulting physicians will remain outside, communicating with the primary doctor or nurse via Teams.

Minnesota’s Allina Health has similarly deployed Microsoft’s Teams to limit caregivers’ exposure to COVID patients. According to Tom Bethke, VP of IS Infrastructure at Allina Health, the system went from having no tablets or chat service in January, to tablets in all of its metro hospitals in just three to four months.

Allina Health's army of tablets allow healthcare providers to remotely speak with coronavirus patients, limiting their risk of exposure to the virus. (Image: Allina Health) More

Inside of each patient room is a tablet that doctors and specialists can connect to remotely, Bethke explained, limiting the number of people who have to actually enter the area.

Well that and overseeing a nearly $10 billion market cap company that similar to other work-from-home tech outfits such as Slack and Zoom is experiencing a transformational moment in their relatively short histories. The importance of the time is not lost on Houston — who co-founded Dropbox in 2007 with Arash Ferdowsi —as he is pushing his team to develop new tools for users that cater even more to a future of working from home.

It’s a world where we will need greater insight into what co-workers are thinking, feeling and doing since we won’t be in the office (at all or not that much). This is the void the likes of Dropbox, Zoom, Slack and others will look to fill in an effort to get us all working collaboratively and efficiently.

“And so what we're thinking about is in our products, given that you lose that human connection, how do you recreate the experience of being together in the app? How do you make it so that you can see what's been going on on your team in a much more organized and focused way? Because a lot of the messaging tools are great. But if you leave your computer for a day and come back, you have to page through all these chats, transcripts and emails and try to piece together what's going on. So what if that were easier? So that's a lot of what we're focused on. From a product standpoint, how do we pull all this together and organize your work and help you focus,” Houston explains to Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Dropbox has already seen an uptick in business as a byproduct of the shift to working from home during the health crisis.

Trial subscriptions to Dropbox’s business and individual services have increased 40% and 25%, respectively, since mid-March. Active users for the company’s new desktop app have surged 60%. Heading into April, Dropbox saw a 20-fold spike in the use of its integration with video calling platform Zoom.

Paying users in the first quarter rose 2.1% sequentially to 14.6 million, ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 14.57 million. Average revenue per user increased to $126.30 from $121.04 a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margins improved to 16.1% from 10.1% last year.

‘Healthy balance of growth and profitability’

The solid start to the year brings Dropbox incrementally closer to the aggressive profit margin forecasts it put out in February. The company said at the time it expects operating margins to reach 28% to 30% by 2024, up from a prior forecast of 20% to 22%.

Worth noting is that those targets came prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that has businesses globally rethinking how they operate and signing up to different services from a Dropbox. Houston won’t say whether the targets— which surprised many on the Street at the time — are now conservative in the wake of COVID-19.

“Well, we've always been focused on delivering a healthy balance of growth and profitability. And when we felt that we had an opportunity to update our long-term model to reflect the inherent efficiency in the business. And then with given COVID we're heading into a pretty unpredictable background environment. So you know, we'll be watching everything closely,” Houston says.

Only time will tell. But Wall Street stays invested in the Dropbox story — 71% of the sell-side analysts who cover the company rate the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data. The average 12-month price target by the analyst community is $26, suggesting at least 24% upside from current levels.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carvana-cvna-stock-worth-attention-162247611.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T16:22:47+00:00,"Hayden Capital recently released its Q1 2020 Investor Letter, a copy of which you can download below. The fund posted a return of 4.10% for the quarter, outperforming their benchmark, the S&P 500 Index which returned -20.00% in the same quarter. You should check out Hayden Capital’s top 5 stock picks which helped them beat the market by nearly 24 percentage points. There weren’t a lot of funds who could deliver these kinds of returns without shorting the market or using aggressive put options.

In the said letter, Hayden Capital highlighted a few stocks and Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) is one of them. Carvana is an e-commerce platform engaged in the buying of used cars. Year-to-date, CVNA stock gained 6.8% and on May 11th it had a closing price of $100.67. Its market cap is of $16.29 billion. Here is what Hayden Capital said:

""Carvana (CVNA): This quarter, Carvana began trialing an interesting new program involving “Partner Inventory” (note, the company hasn’t publicly commented on this initiative before – we discovered the program only after some sleuthing). The basic idea is that instead of purchasing vehicle inventory outright (and tying up capital in the process), Carvana will list vehicles owned by other dealers on their behalf (similar to a consignment / marketplace model)10.

The vehicles are listed on Carvana’s website, but with pictures taken by the dealer themselves. In 2018, Carvana acquired Car360 for $22 million (LINK) – a technology that allows users to take a high-resolution 360-degree representation of a car, with just a smartphone (LINK; Carvana had historically used expensive DSLR rigs and custom photo-booths to provide this experience. Carvana’s dealer partners are likely using Car360’s technology for this initiative).

So why is Carvana opening up its platform and technology to its competitors? Well for Carvana, it allows them to conserve their capital to increase their competitive advantage in the differentiated aspects of the business, such as logistics, marketing and brand-building, etc.

Used car inventory is one of the most commoditized aspects of Carvana’s business. While Carvana may have a far wider selection of vehicles, on an individual car basis, Carvana’s 2017 Black Honda Accord isn’t going to be significantly different than a local dealer’s. What prompts a customer to choose Carvana over a local dealer, is rather the site’s ease of use and payment, transparency, the fact that they’ll deliver the car to your home, and the trust Carvana’s brand has built where consumers are confident they’ll get the car in the condition they were promised and there won’t be any negative surprises down the line.

This initiative also helps Carvana to scale their inventory diversity without capital. It’s important, since the company’s customer feedback suggests that the #1 reason potential customers don’t buy a car from Carvana, is that they “did not find the car [they] were looking for.” (LINK). So expanding the inventory selection / diversity is a major variable in driving Carvana’s growth further – and a basis for both this program and Carvana starting to aggressively encourage trade-ins / sourcing cars directly from customers a year ago.

In the used car industry, typically half of gross profits (and an even larger portion of net profits) are derived from ancillary services, such as selling the finance receivables, selling extended protection plans, GAP coverage, etc. These are high margin products (compared to single digit margins from selling the vehicle itself), and in Carvana’s case comprised ~52% of total gross profits per unit last quarter. Under the Partner Inventory program, Carvana retains these profits and equally important, retains the customer relationship.

If you look at the example snapshot below, you’ll notice that customers don’t see the dealer partner’s name anywhere. Instead, the process is just as if you were buying directly from Carvana’s own inventory pool, and the order / delivery experience is exact same. Unless customers are reading the fine print, they wouldn’t notice a difference.

For dealers, this program allows them to leverage Carvana’s site traffic and customers to turnover their vehicles quicker. Carvana.com generates 100’s of times the traffic than an independent used car lot would generate on its own11. The dealer is giving up half of their potential profits, but in return, the dealer still makes more money in the end if they can reduce the amount of time it takes to sell a car by more than half 12. And in today’s Coronavirus environment, traditional dealers are more desperate than ever to have an easy mechanism to sell their inventory online. It is a win-win for both parties.

If you think about how Amazon built Prime, it was a very similar roadmap. When ecommerce was nascent and consumers weren’t used to / didn’t trust ordering goods online in the 2005, Amazon had to prove that it was an easy and trustworthy experience13.

The only way to do that, was to control the experience from end-to-end, and develop trust for the Amazon Prime brand. This meant investing heavily in inventory, expanding the number of shopping categories, offering 2-day delivery when competitors took a week, etc. Amazon’s profits suffered as a result – but the goodwill it built with customers allowed them to leverage their brand & infrastructure, and eventually monetize it when they expanded to partnering with 3rd Party merchants.

Note, even though other car marketplaces already exist, the model Carvana is pursuing is very different from peers. Unlike other marketplaces, Carvana is providing a standardized level of service and quality guarantee, similar to what Amazon’s Prime program and Fulfilled by Amazon, did for marketplace sellers. Other platforms like Cargurus, are simply a lead generation tool for dealers and don’t control the offline user experience (which is exactly the part of the buying process used car purchasers dislike).

For example, Ebay already existed (and had a much larger network) when Amazon launched marketplace in 2000, and Fulfilled by Amazon in 2006. But what propelled Amazon Marketplace to over-take Ebay, was their ability to provide a consistent customer experience (quick shipping, simplified shopping experience), regardless of which seller’s inventory it was coming from.

While on Ebay, a customer had to research each individual seller’s ratings and make a judgement as to whether the seller was reliable. Depending on which seller a customer bought from, the Ebay experience could vary drastically (the consumer trust rested with the individual store, not with Ebay’s platform).

However on Amazon Marketplace, the customer just had to trust Amazon, since the places in the supply chain that caused variability (shipping times, customer service response times, hassle-free returns) were all standardized and controlled by Amazon itself. Since the goods themselves were commodities, and multiple sellers of the same item would compete to offer the lowest price / the position in the “buy box”, most of the value and customer trust accrued to Amazon.

Carvana seems to be following a similar playbook. Similar to how Amazon educated the consumer and changed online shopping habits with its own 1P business and Amazon Prime, Carvana is doing the same with its marketing and hassle-free experience. Once they proved the market with their own inventory and built the trust, traffic, and infrastructure, Amazon eventually opened up the platform to 3rd Party sellers and provided them with the tools to succeed.

Fulfilled by Amazon held 3P seller’s inventory in its own warehouses, and provided a seamless delivery experience, while allowing sellers to focus on providing high-quality items procured at low prices. Carvana is at this stage now, opening up its reconditioning centers and logistics network, to provide a consistent experience to its customers. Arguably, these standardized aspects are even more important for Carvana, since the items are so much more valuable - it takes more trust in the platform to buy a $20,000 car online than a $10 laundry detergent. So far, Carvana is doing a great job laying the ground work to become the infrastructure provider, preparing for the day when shopping for a car online becomes mainstream.

As it relates to our investment, infrastructure providers also tend to command higher multiples as well, since they sit in a more valuable part of the industry ecosystem. Revenues become more predictable, as the company moves from just a retailer, to a “tax collector” (I described why these “tax collector” businesses are so attractive in our Q1 2019 letter (LINK)).

This quarter, Carvana also did a $600M equity raise and expanded their loan purchase program with Ally to $2BN. This is on top of the $450M of liquidity Carvana had going into the quarter, mostly in the form of cash and revolvers.

Needless to say, this additional capital gives Carvana plenty of runway – even if they don’t earn a single dollar of revenue for the next several quarters. However, this scenario was a highly unlikely possibility, since data we’ve seen indicates that even during the depths of March, Carvana’s sales weren’t affected nearly as much as their competitors. And in recent weeks, their orders have already returned to January / February levels.

Undoubtedly, this was aided by government “stay at home” mandates, which forced many competitor’s brick & mortar lots to close. If you needed a car during this period, Carvana’s “contactless delivery” was one of the only options available and ready to deliver (LINK).

The equity raise in late March took solvency risk off the table (although as stated before, it wasn’t a big risk to begin with, and there were several cost items that Carvana could have cut back on to conserve capital). The market reacted positively though, since it narrowed the range of outcomes and skewed the equity’s expected value upwards14. It doesn’t surprise me that shares have recovered from ~$22 at the lowest point to ~$90 today.

We had sold some of our Carvana shares in late February, after the stock rose +30% in the span of three days. We bought back some of it in the weeks after, but got much more aggressive as the stock fell during this last drawdown. By now we’ve bought back all the shares we sold and more, with most of the purchases in the $30’s and $40’s."""
http://www.moodys.com/page/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PR_906418077&cid=HFGG75LYEO30,AAPL,2020-05-07T18:11:59+00:00,"New York, May 07, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") affirmed the A3 on the Texas Transportation Commission - Central Texas Turnpike System's approximately $1.6 billion (inclusive of accretion) first tier revenue bonds and the Baa1 on the approximately $1.16 billion second tier revenue bonds. The outlook has been revised to stable from positive.

RATING RATIONALE

The A3 first tier is based on the continued strong traffic growth on the system's roads, improving moderate total debt service coverage ratios that Moody's expects to return to around 1.5x after traffic stabilizes following the coronavirus outbreak. The rating is supported by the thriving Austin area economy that will continue to be one of the strongest in the nation and see strong growth as technology companies such as Apple increase work forces in the region, supporting demand for the system's toll roads as population growth spreads the geographic footprint of the service area. Steady implementation of rate increases based on a CPI index-based formula supports the rating. The ratings also positively consider the annual support for O&M expenses provided by the Texas Transportation Commission if needed, however the O&M support has not been needed in recent years given the strong performance of the facilities. The ratings consider the ample liquidity on hand at the system, which is bolstered by the system's practice of pre-paying all of the future year's debt and operating expense from prior year's surplus revenue. The Baa1 second tier rating reflects a subordinated claim on revenue and weaker financial covenants and debt service coverage ratio.

The rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices, and asset price declines, are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The toll road sector has been significantly affected by the shock given its exposure to travel restrictions and sensitivity to consumer demand. Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. As a result of the epidemic, already existing trends of lifestyle changes may accelerate, such as an increase in remote working and teleconferences that could negatively impact traffic volumes and reduce profits for toll roads.

The uncertain rebound in traffic and revenue post the coronavirus will be the key future driver of the long-term credit profile of the toll road. We expect traffic and revenue to decline materially in 2020 compared to 2019 and to remain suppressed in 2021 and thereafter as the changes in user behavior result in lost traffic that will slowly return over time in line with broader economic growth.

OUTLOOK

The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that traffic, and revenue will be negatively affected throughout calendar 2020 and 2021, causing the system to see weaker DSCR during the period. The stable outlook also reflects the ample liquidity of the system to manage through a protracted recovery.

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS

- Moody's net revenue aggregate debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.5x on a sustained basis

- Leverage, as measured by adjusted debt to operating revenue, below 10.0x

- Continued implementation of automatic annual rate increases

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

- Significantly lower than forecasted traffic and revenue growth

- Moody's net revenue aggregate DSCR below 1.20x

- Liquidity below 500 DCOH

- Actions by TTC that would demonstrate lower levels of support for the system

- Additional system debt without related revenue increases

LEGAL SECURITY

First tier bonds are secured by a first lien on gross revenues specified under the trust indenture, primarily toll revenues and fees from the four CTTS roads and a DSRF currently funded at the lesser of a standard three-pronged test. Second tier bonds are secured by a subordinate lien on gross revenue and a DSRF funded at 50% of the lesser of the three-pronged test.

PROFILE

The CTTS 2002 Project consists of three toll roads in the Austin area: SH 130, a 49-mile north-south road located to the east of the city of Austin; SH 45 North, a 12.8-mile road located in Travis and Williamson counties; and Loop 1, a 4.0-mile road also located in Travis and Williamson counties. All three projects (except for one segment of the SH 130) were completed ahead of schedule and under budget by approximately $438 million, primarily due to lower than expected construction bids and good weather. Full tolled operation began in September 2008 for all 3 roads after a phased opening, starting with Loop 1, followed by SH 45 and then by SH 130 segments 1-4. Fiscal 2009 was the first full year of operation. A fourth toll road, SH 45 SE, was added to the system in September 2012 pursuant to a minute order adopted by the TTC.

The roads were developed to provide traffic congestion relief in the service area. The project received a $700 million equity contribution from TxDOT as well as substantial right-of-way contributions from the area municipalities that helped mitigate development costs. At completion the CTTS 2002 project became part of the state highway system, and provides important links to the north-south interstate highway system.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/faangs-1-higher-tech-lower-154458713.html,FB,2020-05-07T15:44:58+00:00,"The acronym FAANG was coined a few years ago by CNBC host Jim Cramer to denote five tech firms that are ""totally dominant in their markets"": Facebook (symbol FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). I think he made a mistake in leaving out Microsoft (MSFT), so let's expand the group to six and call them FAAMNG (pronounced ""faming"").

FAAMNG firms have been hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic and the crash in energy prices, but not as much as the market as a whole. Since the bear market began, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the U.S. benchmark, has lost 14.8%, while the FAAMNG stocks, on average, lost 5.3%. For the year ending April 17, the S&P is up 1.1% but the FAAMNG six are up an average of 23.3%.

One reason the companies performed relatively well is that they conduct nearly all their activities online, so social distancing harmed them less than, say, brick-and-mortar retailers or the travel industry. But there's much more to the story. FAAMNG firms provide longer-term lessons for investors seeking stocks that can withstand the shocks that are becoming more common in our interconnected world.

Size matters. The first lesson is that, like a giant ship, a giant company is better equipped to ride out the worst storms. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first U.S. stock with a market capitalization (stock price times shares outstanding) of $1 trillion. Three other FAAMNG companies followed. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon retain their 13-figure status; Alphabet has dropped to just under $900 billion. Those four are the largest U.S. firms by market cap, with Facebook in fifth place. Netflix ranks 24th, but it's still larger than such behemoths as Chevron (CVX), Comcast (CMCSA) and McDonald's (MCD).

Bigger is no guarantee of better. In October 2007, the two largest stocks were ExxonMobil (XOM), at about $500 billion, and General Electric (GE), at $400 billion. Today, their combined market cap is less than $250 billion. The reasons for the fall are instructive. Exxon's profits are highly dependent on the price of a single commodity; GE became an unmanageable leviathan with too many businesses.

By contrast, the FAAMNG stocks have firm control of their primary markets. Google and Facebook together split about half of global digital advertising revenues, which currently represent more than half of all ad sales in the U.S., China and most other large countries. Google's search engine has an 87% market share. Facebook has 2.4 billion monthly users (it's the most popular social media site in the world), and it owns Whats-App and Instagram, too, which have another 2.6 billion users between them. Amazon accounts for half of U.S. online retail spending. Seven out of eight U.S. streaming subscribers have a subscription to Netflix; Apple's global smartphone market share exceeds 50%; and Microsoft's Windows operating system runs on 77% of desktop computers.

FAAMNG stocks have room to grow, as well. Digital advertising and streaming video are still young markets, and Amazon's overall share of U.S. retail is still just 5%. Smartphones still have not been adopted by three-fifths of the world's population, and Microsoft keeps bringing out new variations of software and cloud products, lifting revenues by a cumulative 30% over the past two years.

FAAMNG companies are seen as growth stocks; in normal times, their earnings increase at a faster clip than the rest of the market. They also have excellent balance sheets. Four of the six have a top rating of A++ for financial strength from Value Line Investment Survey. Amazon is rated A+; Netflix, a very solid A.

""Downturns are capitalism's sorting mechanism,"" said a recent article in The Economist. Or, as Warren Buffett said, more colorfully, ""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."" In the past three recessions, companies whose share-price returns landed in the top fourth of each sector rose by an average of 6%; stocks in the bottom fourth fell by 44%. Firms that survive and even thrive have a surfeit of assets that are easy to liquidate, plus modest liabilities. That gives them the cash to stay afloat, the credit to borrow (if necessary) and the ability to buy smaller firms at bargain prices.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-workplace-never-same-120039539.html,FB,2020-05-06T16:21:00+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- When the headquarters of Mission Bio reopens next week, employees will find many of the familiar perks they enjoyed before Silicon Valley went into lockdown have changed. Instead of the communal trays of catered lunches served a few times a week, each employee will get their own boxed meal. The snacks will remain free, but the soda machine and tub of almonds will be replaced with canned beverages, bottled water and individually wrapped protein bites. One new benefit: Every two weeks, the startup plans to provide Covid-19 tests onsite to any staff member who wants one.

Mission Bio is returning to the office sooner than most businesses in Northern California. Officials have extended stay-at-home orders through the end of May, and some of the largest technology companies have indicated that they may keep offices closed for even longer. Mission Bio, which develops cellular chemistry technology, said it decided to reopen after consulting local officials who determined that the startup’s cancer research qualifies as essential. “Cancer didn’t work from home,” said Nigel Beard, the chief technology officer.

The startup’s preparations for a return to the office offer a window into the unique challenges of adapting the Silicon Valley workspace to a pandemic. Mission Bio’s desks are arranged in an open-floor plan, a mainstay of the tech office that’s entirely incompatible with social distancing guidelines. The company will keep the office open seven days a week and ask employees to select shifts, so that only a third of staff are present at a time. The lab stations are designed to be communal, but researchers will be required to work solo. Employees will have their temperatures checked by thermometer guns upon arrival and will be asked whether they or their family members have had coughs, fevers or trouble breathing.

The biggest tech companies are taking similar steps for when they finally return to campus. Apple Inc. intends to stagger the introduction of employees back to the office, conduct temperature checks, keep people apart and create some kind of health checklist, Tim Cook, the chief executive officer, told employees in a virtual meeting last month. He said the Cupertino, California, headquarters won’t reopen until at least early June and workers would likely be reintroduced on a “staggered basis.” Google, whose campuses are designed to draw employees together to their many cafeterias and volleyball courts, doesn’t plan to return until at least June, either. The company expects to make changes to its open-office design before staff return, said a person familiar with the preparations.

Facebook Inc. is looking at ways to reconfigure its open-floor plan but is in no hurry to return because most employees can do their jobs from home, David Wehner, the chief financial officer, said on Bloomberg Television. Amazon.com Inc. told corporate staff across the world that if they are able to work effectively from home, they can stay there until at least October. Those who come in will be given face coverings.

On the day tech workers finally do go back, the first change many will notice is on their morning commute. The shuttle buses provided by larger companies may not operate at full capacity, and some employers might encourage people to drive to avoid public transportation. Upon arrival, they’ll find redesigned lobbies. To funnel thousands of workers safely, companies are looking to use design tricks like stickers on the floor or carefully placed furniture to create barriers, said Primo Orpilla, co-founder of the San Francisco-based interior design company Studio O+A, whose clients include Microsoft Corp., Slack Technologies Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.

Tech companies are particularly concerned with changes that could compromise their carefully curated aesthetic. Nobody wants rope barriers that make people feel like they’re at an airport, Orpilla said. They’re looking for an artistic version of crowd control. “If Shepard Fairey were in charge of making sure social distancing was part of your space, how would he do it?” Orpilla said, referring to the creator of the “Hope” Obama campaign posters. In a change that would please George Costanza, some clients are considering rebuilding bathroom stalls so the walls extend from the floor to the ceiling, he said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/druckenmiller-says-risk-reward-stocks-205112811.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T23:00:57+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Stan Druckenmiller said the risk-reward calculation for equities is the worst he’s seen in his career, and that the government stimulus programs won’t be enough to overcome real world economic problems.

“The consensus out there seems to be: ‘Don’t worry, the Fed has your back,’” said Druckenmiller on Tuesday during a webcast held by The Economic Club of New York. “There’s only one problem with that: our analysis says it’s not true.”

While traders think there is “massive” liquidity and that the stimulus programs are big enough to solve the problems facing the U.S., the economic effects of the coronavirus are likely to be long lasting and will lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said.

“I pray I’m wrong on this, but I just think that the V-out is a fantasy,” the legendary hedge fund manager said, referring to a V-shaped recovery.

Druckenmiller’s remarks are among the strongest comments yet by a Wall Street heavyweight on the bleak outlook facing the U.S. They also stand in contrast to the optimism that has pushed the S&P 500 Index to rally almost 30% since its March low even as the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill, seized up credit markets and ended the longest bull market in history.

The damage spurred the Federal Reserve to unveil a raft of emergency lending programs and Congress to unleash almost $3 trillion in stimulus funds. But those programs aren’t likely to spur future economic growth, Druckenmiller said.

“It was basically a combination of transfer payments to individuals, basically paying them more not to work than to work,” he said. “And in addition to that, it was a bunch of payments to zombie companies to keep them alive.”

Druckenmiller said he thinks that the current liquidity will soon shrink as U.S. Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases.

Druckenmiller, 66, the former chief strategist for George Soros, converted his hedge fund into Duquesne Family Office in 2010. His long-term track record, making returns of about 30% a year over three decades, established him as one of the world’s top money mangers. He has an estimated net worth of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Like other investors and Wall Street executives, Druckenmiller agrees that the pandemic will lead to more regulation and higher taxes.

Other highlights from the Druckenmiller interview:

In the future, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak becomes the “poster child for the worst public policy decisions ever made from a cost-benefit analysis.”On a relative basis, he’s as bullish on long-short strategies as he’s been in 10 years. “That’s partly because I’m worried about everything else,” he said.Druckenmiller was also bullish on Amazon.com Inc., saying people should be thankful that the company exists right now given the number of jobs created. He also praised its transition to less profitable, essential-needs products without raising prices.

The fund posted a return of -21.7% for the quarter, underperforming its benchmark, the S&P 500 Index which returned -19.6% in the same quarter. You should check out Alphyn Capital’s top 5 stock picks for investors to buy right now, which could be the biggest winners of the stock market crash.

In the said letter, Alphyn Capital spoke about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stocks. Alphabet and Amazon are technology companies. Year-to-date, GOOG stock gained 5.0% and on May 11th it had a closing price of $1403.26. GOOG's market cap is of $958 billion. Meanwhile, year-to-date, AMZN stock gained 30.5% and on May 11th it had a closing price of $2409.00. AMZN's market cap is of $1.2 trillion. Here is what Alphyn Capital said:

""We added Alphabet and Amazon to the portfolio. These are of course well known and understood companies and, together with existing holdings Tencent/Naspers/Prosus, have some of the strongest economic moats in existence in business today. It is difficult to imagine a world (at least in the next several years) in which these companies with their massive cash balances (~$32bn Alphabet, ~$115bn Amazon) face real existential risk. If anything, the current crisis has only accelerated the cloud/online and e-commerce trends. Well known as these companies are, I do not believe the market (certainly not today) accounts for their future earnings power, in particular Amazon which is coming of a multi-year capex investment cycle with significant avenues for future growth.""

In Q4 2019, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on AMZN stock increased by about 12% from the previous quarter (see the chart here), so a number of other hedge fund managers seem to agree with Amazon's upside potential.

""The Mac and Logic Pro X are essential tools used by the world’s top musicians and producers to create the music that we all love,"" said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing. ""Logic Pro X 10.5 represents the biggest update to Logic since the launch of Logic Pro X, with powerful new tools that will inspire every artist — from those just getting started with Logic, to those already using it to produce Grammy Award-winning albums. We can’t wait to hear what these artists create next.""

Pro musicians and producers are already expressing their excitement for Logic Pro X 10.5, saying:

""Logic Pro X has always been my one and only DAW. The workflow is unmatched, and the built-in sound libraries have been essential to my music from the beginning. Now with the addition of Quick Sampler and Drum Machine Designer, I’m getting back hours I used to spend in the studio building sounds and kits. This lets me spend more time writing new verses and editing 70-take vocals."" — Finneas O’Connell, Grammy Award-winning producer: Billie Eilish, ""Bad Guy"" and the album ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?""

""Logic Pro X 10.5 has changed the way we approach making music. We’ve been working with all the new features, from recording sounds with the MacBook Pro’s built-in mic directly into Quick Sampler, to quickly arranging a song while simultaneously recording artists using the Live Loops grid. Logic has been used for years on all our productions and the new version will make it even faster for us to create lasting songs."" — Denzel Baptiste and David Biral of Take a Daytrip, Grammy-nominated producers: Lil Nas X, ""Panini""; Sheck Wes, ""Mo Bamba""; Travis Scott and Kid Cudi, ""THE SCOTTS""; Juice WRLD, ""Legends""; Dua Lipa, ""Good In Bed""; and YBN Cordae, ""Kung Fu.""

Live Loops

With Live Loops on the Mac®, Logic® users can now create music in new freeform and nonlinear ways. Loops, samples, and recordings can be organized into a new musical grid, where musicians can spontaneously perform and capture different arrangement ideas into the timeline. From there, tracks can be further refined using all of the professional production features in Logic.

Remix FX enhances Live Loops with an exciting collection of electronic effects like Bitcrusher, filter, gater, and repeater that can be performed in real time over individual tracks or the entire song mix. Both features become even more powerful when using the free Logic Remote app, allowing users to pair their iPhone® or iPad® with their Mac to provide Multi-Touch™ control over Live Loops and Remix FX.

In a New York Times interview published Monday, Quibi founder Jeffrey Katzenberg detailed the premium platform's initial shortcomings.

Katzenberg lays the blame for Quibi's slow start squarely on the shoulders of the coronavirus pandemic. The service is entertaining just 1.3 million active users despite springing for Super Bowl ads earlier this year and a murderers' row of short-form content. Social media is blasting Katzenberg for his comments, especially since Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and Disney's (NYSE:DIS) namesake service are seemingly thriving in the new normal. Katzenberg isn't entirely off the mark in playing up the pandemic that's been a tailwind to larger platforms as a headwind for Quibi, but it also doesn't hurt to recognize that the model was going to be flawed anyway.

Funeral plot twist

Quibi launched on April 6 with a bizarre model. Quibi -- short for ""quick bites"" -- loaded up on short episodes of original shows and exclusive movies doled out in tapas-sized chapters. There's nothing wrong with specializing in short-form content. YouTube and TikTok are proof that there's a market out there of folks who want a quick burst of entertainment.

However, YouTube and TikTok are free platforms. Quibi hit the market as a premium offering charging $4.99 a month, with viewers still having to put up with ads. The ad-free plan costs $7.99 a month. Quibi also made the gutsy move of being a mobile-first platform, initially available only for iOS and Android devices. It was meant for commuters or folks on work or school breaks with about 10 minutes to spare, and on that front it's fair for Katzenberg to blame COVID-19. Folks are at home, and they have a lot more time on their hands, and that's in the sweet spot of what Netflix and Disney+ can offer. The average Roku user is streaming more than 3.6 hours a day of content.

However, there is still a lot of blame that should fall squarely on Quibi's plate. When it launched with a 90-day free trial for anyone signing up before the end of April and then switched to a 14-day complimentary trial, some assumed that was a good sign. We now know that it wasn't. Katzenberg says that the app was downloaded 3.5 million times, and since everyone is in theory on a free trial, it's shocking that nearly two-thirds of them are no longer active users.

Katzenberg suggests that Netflix also didn't have a good first month with signups when it launched, but that was 13 years ago, when you needed a PC or an Xbox to stream its then-lean catalog. If anything, the slow start to Netflix on the streaming front was because it limited its audience to specific devices, a mistake that Quibi is repeating. When Disney+ launched in November across essentially all devices, it had 10 million members signed up the very first day.

You don't get a second chance to make a first impression, and that's why Quibi is doomed here. It's no longer a hot app download. It doesn't have a large enough audience to create a mainstream hit the way that Disney+ did with The Mandalorian out of the gate or Netflix does every few weeks with a new franchise. Quibi is starting to tweak the model. It's starting to make some of its content available outside of the mobile app. Unfortunately it's too little too late. Consumers are back to their earlier streaming platforms or eyeing the pipeline to see if the next major launch will stick its landing. Folks that didn't sign up when they could have gotten three free months aren't going to give the current 14-day trial a shot. Content consumers have pride, you know.

If you're a premium service limited to small screens, it doesn't matter if you have big stars including Chrissy Teigen, Sam Raimi, and Sophie Turner in your lineup. The coronavirus crisis didn't help, but it's not the only or even the main reason why Quibi is failing."

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-work-v-softbank-a-3-billion-battle-involving-two-ailing-companies-122840662.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T12:28:40+00:00,"Who could possibly blame SoftBank for walking away last month from its $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares—part of a $9.5 billion bailout package it signed last October?

SoftBank Group (SFTBY) is the Tokyo-based, publicly traded conglomerate founded by entrepreneur and investor Masayoshi Son in 1981. Son, who still runs the company, made his name and fortune with early bets on Yahoo in 1995; Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group (BABA) in 1999; and Japanese telecom companies. In 2017, SoftBank formed the SoftBank Vision Fund, a $100 billion, tech-focused venture fund composed of capital from the likes of the Saudi Arabian and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds, Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), Foxconn, and Sharp. Since then, SoftBank has often coordinated its investments with the Vision Fund’s.

One of those bets, alas, was the now troubled co-working, office-space startup, WeWork. As of April 1, when SoftBank called off its tender offer for WeWork shares, SoftBank and the Vision Fund had already together plowed $14.25 billion into the firm—a company that hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman pegged last October as having “a pretty high probability of being a zero.”

Even assuming WeWork ever had a viable business model—a big if—COVID-19 appears to have put it in the deep freeze for the next six to 18 months. Then add to the mix the fact that SoftBank’s own financial condition has been gravely deteriorating. SoftBank is forecasting an annual $16.7 billion operating loss for its Vision Fund, and a $12 billion operating loss for the group as a whole, due to disappointing bets on—in addition to WeWork—Uber (UBER) (lackluster IPO), dog-walking startup Wag (sold for a loss), satellite-operator OneWeb (in Chapter 11), and hotel-play OYO (reeling from coronavirus repercussions). In late March, Moody’s dissed SoftBank’s debt with a rare, two-notch downgrade.

The market’s faith in the investment intuition of SoftBank founder Son has been shaken, and Son has been forced to postpone plans for a $108 billion Vision Fund 2. Activist investor Elliott Management—which surfaced its $2.5 billion stake in SoftBank in February—has been breathing down Son’s neck, demanding fire sales of assets and greater transparency.

Finally, there’s the kicker. Had SoftBank gone through with the tender offer, the single biggest beneficiary—siphoning off up to $970 million of SoftBank’s largesse—would have been Adam Neumann, a persona extremely non grata around both WeWork and SoftBank these days. Neumann is the company’s charismatic, surfer-dude co-founder and former CEO, who, like WeWork itself, is now under scrutiny by two state attorneys general, the S.E.C., and Manhattan state and federal prosecutors, who are looking into self-dealing and disclosure issues.

Yet, there’s a “yet” here. It’s a big one. Because there’s something to be said for that October bailout contract, of which the tender offer was an integral part. SoftBank signed it. And contracts are contracts.

On April 7, a special committee of the board of The We Company, WeWork’s parent, sued SoftBank and the SoftBank Vision Fund in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking “specific performance” of the bailout deal—meaning an order forcing SoftBank to follow through on the tender offer. (For brevity, this article will refer to The We Company as WeWork.) The committee also wants to force SoftBank to provide WeWork with another $1.1 billion in debt financing which SoftBank was supposed to provide if and when the tender offer closed.

Story continues

“SoftBank’s wrongful action constitutes both a breach of contract and a breach of fiduciary duty to WeWork’s minority stockholders, including hundreds of its current and former employees,” the special committee said in a press release at the time.

SoftBank parried: “Nothing in the special committee’s filing . . . credibly refutes SoftBank’s decision to terminate the tender offer. Several of the conditions the special committee, WeWork, Adam Neumann, SoftBank and SoftBank Vision Fund agreed to last October as requirements for completing the tender were not met as of April 1, 2020.” (A spokesperson for WeWork itself—which is distinct from the special committee—declined comment for this article.)

On May 4, Neumann filed his own suit against SoftBank, and asked for it to be joined with the special committee’s. SoftBank swiftly pronounced Neumann’s suit “meritless” as well.

SoftBank’s shaky arguments for backing out

Specifically, SoftBank claims that at least five contractual conditions of closing the tender offer were never met, giving it ample grounds to back out of the deal. Two of those seem to be the crux of the matter. First, WeWork failed to complete a “rollup” involving its Chinese joint venture, which was a prerequisite for closing. (Basically, shareholders of the joint venture were supposed to exchange their shares for shares in WeWork.) Second, the bailout contract also specified that SoftBank could walk away if WeWork became the target of civil or criminal investigations that threatened “material liability”—a situation SoftBank claims now exists.

As yet another basis for walking, SoftBank also tossed in the COVID-19 pandemic as something akin to a force majeure event. That legal term (French for “a greater force”) refers to an act-of-God that neither party anticipated and that so radically changes the landscape of a deal that a party will be deemed justified in backing out.

But each of these arguments looks shaky. WeWork’s special committee claims to have evidence, for instance, that it was actually SoftBank itself that secretly sabotaged the rollup of the Chinese joint venture—referred to in the legal filings as ChinaCo. Specifically, it says that SoftBank CEO Son himself—quite two-facedly, if true—helped persuade a key ChinaCo shareholder to veto the rollup, cratering the deal.

As for the civil and criminal probes, the special committee argues that they pose no threat of “material liability”; that one of them was already public before the bailout deal was even inked; and that the rest of them surfaced before SoftBank happily agreed to an amendment to the deal on Dec. 27.

Finally, force majeure is always a longshot argument. Only once in history has a Delaware court let a party out of a contract on that basis. (That was in 2018, when German pharmaceutical firm Fresenius Kabi was allowed to back out of a merger with generics manufacturer Akorn, after the latter not only suffered drastic financial setbacks but was exposed, by whistleblowers, as having failed to comply with FDA regulatory requirements.)

Furthermore, unlike most multi-billion-dollar commercial deals, the WeWork bailout contract conspicuously lacks a “material adverse event” clause—the ordinary escape-hatch for force majeure events. SoftBank apparently seeks to shoehorn its COVID-19 claims into some other clause, though it’s not yet clear precisely which one.

This is a cautionary tale, then, about the fallout after an investing wizard got snookered by his own whiz-kid. It’s about a high-stakes legal battle involving two desperately struggling companies, each of which looked to be at the top of the world a scant nine months ago.

Just how desperate are they? It’s unclear. Last month, the special committee urged the judge to rush the case to trial by August, warning that “SoftBank’s financial condition grows increasingly perilous, placing SoftBank’s ability to later complete a $3 billion tender offer in jeopardy.”

SoftBank’s CFO then responded that its financial position was “stable” and that it had “a strong balance sheet”—including $35 billion in cash as of April 14—requesting a more leisurely trial date of April 2021. Chancellor Andre Bouchard split the baby, setting trial for January.

Predicting the outcome of this messy, multi-part dispute is obviously guesswork at this point. Not only have most of the facts not yet come out, but the full terms of the October contract are still under seal.

Billions down the WeWork drain

Despite all the uncertainty, we do know that courts don’t let parties out of contracts easily. That’s the whole point of contracts. Jill Fisch, a business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, thinks SoftBank faces an uphill battle on several of its claims, including its motion to dismiss, which will be decided this summer.

“It sounds like a case that should at least be heard,” she says.

Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor of both contracts and mergers and acquisitions, thinks that some kind of tender offer will probably occur—though maybe a tweaked one.

“If I had to bet,” says Talley, “I’d bet the case settles with a different tender offer—one a little to SoftBank’s advantage.” That could mean a reduced share price or fewer shares purchased, for instance.

If so, that would likely still be good news for both Neumann and early investor Benchmark Capital. Benchmark tendered $627 million in shares in the aborted deal. (The special committee of WeWork’s board that is suing SoftBank consists of Benchmark partner Bruce Dunlevie and former Coach CEO Lew Frankfort, who leads investment funds that tendered $40 million worth of shares in the cancelled transaction.)

That sort of compromise might also be good news for the 850 or so current and former WeWork employees who had also hoped to cash in their shares.

But nearly any realistic settlement would likely be bad news for SoftBank. It would be sending yet more money—maybe billions—down the WeWork drain.

How WeWork did itself in

WeWork has become a singular case study among “it” companies brought low. Usually—think Theranos, Valeant, or Enron—downfalls are triggered by some combination of investigative reporters, whistle-blowers, short-sellers, and regulators.

WeWork, in contrast, was done in by its own S-1. That’s the S.E.C.’s term for the prospectus a private company files when it launches an initial public offering. Made public last August, WeWork’s S-1 revealed such staggering operating losses (almost $1.4 billion for just the first six months of 2019), egregious conflicts of interest, extravagant expenses, and opaque and dubious accounting metrics that analysts were left stunned and appalled. Harvard Business School senior lecturer Nori Gerardo Lietz, who had already drafted a skeptical case study entitled “Will WeWork Work?,” quickly published a savage revision called “Why WeWork Won’t.”

The IPO was yanked at the end of September, leaving WeWork without the funding it needed to survive past November. WeWork then began weighing competing rescue packages from SoftBank and JPMorgan. It formed the special committee—composed of the two WeWork directors with no ties to either SoftBank or Neumann—to evaluate them. The committee chose SoftBank’s package, in part because of the allure of the tender offer, the committee contends.

The terms of the SoftBank bailout

The SoftBank bailout deal, which was signed Oct. 22, called for a number of things to happen in three distinct phases, according to the parties’ submissions.

In phase one, SoftBank injected an immediate $1.5 billion of equity financing into WeWork in exchange for Neumann surrendering control of the company. The investment was actually an acceleration of a preexisting SoftBank commitment to buy WeWork shares, but the share price was now slashed by 89%, from $110 to $11.60.

This first phase—which was completed within a week of signing—also involved corporate governance changes. Neumann stepped down from the board and gave WeWork a proxy for his shares, which had, until then, been controlling, due to super-voting rights (10 votes per share). Neumann received an immediate $185 million at this point—characterized as compensation for a noncompete and nonsolicitation agreement—and SoftBank loaned him $423 million.

The plaintiffs in the two suits say that this phase also gave SoftBank effective control over the company. In fact, the special committee argues, that’s why there’s no “material adverse effect” escape hatch in the contract. Since SoftBank was wrenching control in phase one, it would have obviously been unfair to allow it to then call off subsequent phases, in which other parties were supposed to get their value.

The contract unquestionably does give SoftBank and the SoftBank Vision Fund the power, collectively, to appoint at least five of up to 10 board seats. The contract appoints SoftBank’s own chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, to WeWork’s board, and Claure became WeWork’s executive chairman within days thereafter.

SoftBank denies it controls WeWork, but its legalistic arguments may prove a hard sell in Delaware. It contends, for instance, that the SoftBank Vision Fund—whose three-man investment committee consists of SoftBank’s chairman and CEO Son, SoftBank vice chairman Ron Fisher, and SoftBank executive vice president Rajeev Misra—is not really controlled by SoftBank itself. (SoftBank and the Vision Fund are being represented in the litigation by different, high-priced law firms.) Nevertheless, as of March, SoftBank owned 43.4% of WeWork’s shares, while the SoftBank Vision Fund owned 8.9%, giving the two—um—closely allied entities 52.3% between them. If SoftBank does control the WeWork board, then it also controls Neumann’s shares, representing another 14.1% of the company.

Phase two of the bailout contract, as originally drafted, called for the $3 billion tender offer to take place. It was priced at $19.19 per share, which meant that SoftBank was now valuing WeWork at around $8 billion, compared to $47 billion in January 2019.

The tender offer would have effectively given Neumann the rest of his payoff for relinquishing control in October, while also giving “liquidity” to Benchmark, a few other early investors, and about 850 current and former employees. All parties agreed to use their “reasonable best efforts” to do “all things necessary” to consummate the tender offer. (The tender offer process began on Nov. 22.)

Phase three, as originally envisioned, called for SoftBank to provide three types of debt financing, totaling $5 billion, to help secure WeWork’s longer-term future. (That broke down as $2.2 billion in unsecured notes; a $1.75 billion unsecured letter of credit; and $1.1 billion in secured notes.) Originally, this $5 billion was to become available to SoftBank either simultaneously with the closing of the tender offer or afterward.

Was SoftBank secretly plotting to sabotage the tender offer?

In November, however, things began to go south for SoftBank itself. SoftBank’s Son announced at a news conference in Tokyo that, due to earnings “of the deepest red,” the group would be reporting its biggest quarterly loss in its 38-year history. Son publicly apologized for his “really bad judgment” in championing WeWork.

In December, SoftBank asked for an amendment to the original bailout deal. It wanted to change the sequencing of the deal, by allowing the unsecured portions of the debt financing—the $1.75 billion credit facility and the $2.2 billion in notes—to close before the tender offer closed. The amendment also extended the time to complete the tender offer from late December to April 1.

Neumann evidently smelled a rat. While SoftBank had an interest in doing these debt financings—they would keep WeWork, in which it had invested so much, afloat—it had precious little incentive to do the tender offer, which would be throwing money out the window from its perspective.

Since Neumann was getting nothing out of the amendment, and might be losing much, he refused to sign. The special committee did not object to the amendment, however, so SoftBank simply removed the signature block for Neumann’s signature, according to Neumann’s complaint. On Dec. 27, the amendment was adopted.

That amendment also contained recitations—by SoftBank and SoftBank Vision Fund—to the effect that they had been using their “reasonable best efforts” to meet the closing conditions for the tender offer, according to Neumann’s complaint. (The text of the amendment has not yet become public.) This fact infuriates Neumann because, unbeknownst to him, SoftBank had actually been secretly plotting to sabotage the tender offer since November, according to the special committee’s complaint. It had allegedly approached Trustbridge Partners, a minority shareholder in WeWork’s Chinese joint venture, ChinaCo, with a deal proposal that would be more attractive to it than participating in the rollup envisioned in the bailout agreement. That would induce Trustbridge to veto the rollup, giving SoftBank an excuse to back out of the tender offer, the special committee theorizes.

In fact, just one day before the amendment was signed—Dec. 26—SoftBank was putting the crowning touches on this plot, according to the special committee. That day, SoftBank CEO Son, SoftBank chief operating officer Claure, and Michel Combes (CEO of SoftBank-owned Sprint) allegedly met in person with Trustbridge representatives about a deal that would give Trustbridge control of ChinaCo—definitively wrecking the rollup. If true, SoftBank would seem to have been blatantly violating its contractual obligation to use “best efforts” to make the tender offer happen, and would probably also have been breaching fiduciary duties to WeWork’s minority shareholders.

SoftBank has not yet addressed these allegations head-on, other than to assert, in its motion opposing an August trial date, that the roll-up failed due to “the independent actions of . . . third-party Chinese investors in the ChinaCo joint venture.” It appears, also, that SoftBank will argue that those recitations in the amendment, about its using “best efforts,” are now binding on the special committee in some way. According to a source, SoftBank is likely to argue that “WeWork employees” were actively involved in the Trustbridge negotiations, and that “WeWork” also signed a recitation in the Dec. 27 amendment to the effect that all parties were using “best efforts” to complete the tender offer. (Of course, according to the plaintiffs, SoftBank controlled WeWork by then.)

In February, as was now permitted under the amendment, SoftBank proceeded to provide WeWork with the $1.75 billion line of credit and the $2.2 billion in unsecured debt, even though the tender offer had still not been completed. (In exchange for the debt, SoftBank received another 129 million shares of WeWork, for one penny each.)

A global health emergency that’s particularly bad for WeWork

By then, new storm clouds were gathering on the horizon. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency, due to the outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19. The Trump Administration imposed restrictions on travel from China the next day.

“Quite candidly,” says Harvard Business School senior lecturer Nori Gerardo Lietz in an interview, “in light of the pandemic, I can’t think of a worse business model [than WeWork’s].” Gerardo Lietz runs her own real estate advisory firm, Areté Capital, in addition to teaching.

Here’s what she means. COVID-19—and the deep recession it now seems to be triggering—together create at least two colossal challenges for WeWork. Both were apparent from Gerardo Lietz’s published analyses of the company last year, though no one had yet foreseen a pandemic.

The first was a challenge that many WeWork skeptics had identified. Beneath all its New-Age and tech-world buzzwords—WeWork liked to say that its mission was “to elevate the world’s consciousness,” for instance, and that it sold “space-as-a-service”—WeWork was in the business of “rent arbitrage.” It rented building space for long durations, and sublet it for short durations—theoretically at a higher price. Its master leases with landlords averaged about 15 years, while its sublets to customers averaged about 90 days for individuals and small businesses, and about three years for enterprise clients. About 60% of its tenants—whom it referred to as “members”—were the former.

So one obvious risk was that, in the face of a severe recession, the company would be left on the hook for its master leases long after its sublet tenants had fled for the hills. Credit risk was yet another issue, because so many members were shallow-pocketed freelancers and startups. (The American unit of a UK-based coworking office-space company, IWG—then known as Regus—did, in fact, go into Chapter 11 in 2003, after the dot-com bust.)

WeWork always had arguments at the ready to counter such skeptics. Neumann maintained, for instance, that in a recession many tenants would actually be attracted to WeWork, because of its flexible leases.

But a recession touched off by an infectious-disease pandemic was another matter. As Gerardo Lietz sees it, packing people densely into office space—precisely what social distancing now forbids—lay at the core of WeWork’s arbitrage model. That was a big part of how the company would make more from its subleases than it was paying for its master leases.

“Neumann’s basic concept,” Gerardo Lietz explained in her case study late last year, “was to create working spaces whereby people would be in very close physical proximity to one another. This physical proximity, coupled with the other amenities WeWork offered its tenants, creates a physical environment that should foster a ‘community.’ . . . The average density for traditional office buildings was approximately 150 square feet per person, while WeWork targets approximately 50-60 square feet per person.”

WeWork treated density—which fostered “community”—as a positive thing. “The halls and stairways are deliberately made narrow as a way of encouraging people to interact,” the Economist reported of WeWork in July 2018. WeWork representatives made the same boast to New York Magazine as recently as last June. WeWork’s S-1 used the word “community” 150 times.

At this stage, we don’t know how big a role the unfurling pandemic played—if any—in SoftBank’s decision to scrap the tender offer. We do know that on March 12, the day President Donald Trump imposed restraints on travel from Europe, a SoftBank lawyer warned WeWork that the ChinaCo rollup condition had still not been met. Five days later, SoftBank issued a formal warning to WeWork shareholders of at least four unmet conditions—including the failed rollup and the government probes—but not yet referencing COVID-19.

On March 27, four days before the tender offer was due to close, WeWork began trying to renegotiate some master leases. SoftBank supported the strategy. Nevertheless, when the special committee sought assurances that SoftBank wouldn’t claim that the lease negotiations triggered escape valves in the tender offer contract, SoftBank refused, according to the committee’s complaint.

SoftBank aborted the tender offer on April 1. It then did, indeed, take the position that WeWork’s attempts “to stop its rent payments” had opened still another exit door in the contract, in addition to the four already cited. It added that “numerous local, state and national governments have taken new actions related to COVID-19, imposing restrictions against the Company and its operations in various locations around the world,” although it didn’t specify which escape provision of the contract this triggered.

Key details to emerge

On Friday, May 15, SoftBank will file a brief supporting its motion to dismiss the special committee’s suit. It is expected to argue—as it did in a letter to WeWork’s board in mid-April—that the special committee is not authorized to sue on WeWork’s behalf, and also that it suffers from certain disqualifying conflicts of interest.

“I didn’t think it was a very convincing argument,” says Fisch, of the University of Pennsylvania, referring to the version sent to WeWork’s board. “The special committee’s mandate was pretty broad, and since they were tasked with essentially bringing the agreement to fruition, I think implicit in that would be the power to enforce the agreement.”

In any case, even if SoftBank’s motion succeeds, it will not stop Neumann’s suit from going forward. Nor, in all probability, would it stop Benchmark or Lew Frankfort’s funds—the shareholders with most at stake after Neumann—from suing on their own behalf.

So one way or another, we are likely to learn more about exactly what SoftBank’s Masa Son said to Trustbridge about ChinaCo last December, as well as other intriguing details of how the tender offer came to unravel.

Alternatively, SoftBank could pay Neumann, Benchmark, and Frankfort to go away. And that won’t come cheap.

Operator [1]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shelly Kay Pfeiffer, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [2]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.

Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Story continues

And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [3]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.

I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.

While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.

In our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for nonessential products, including reducing our marketing spend.

Our network pivoted to shipping priority of products within 1 to 4 days and extending promises on nonpriority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores as more than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers.

We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60% and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Food stores from over -- from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.

AWS has created data lake to assist health care workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling videoconferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.

Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.

How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at a cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for nonessential items.

While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.

With that, let's open up for questions.

================================================================================

Questions and Answers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [1]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD [2]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID-related incremental costs in 2Q, you talked about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying, trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in 2Q and whether over time, does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [3]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Sure, Doug. First, on testing. So we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We've put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we need it for -- to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to -- and again, we'll see how we do that differently. And I don't know, again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is getting testing in the hands of our employees. And then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, the -- a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people costs, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So we can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I'm only giving -- we're only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months, and we'll continue to update this. But for now, most of what we see are temporary costs in the scheme of things but certainly very expensive temporary costs and also ones that we're not sure how long that will last.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [4]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst [5]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2, Brian. The first one is the current situation is sort of, I think, in many ways, sort of showcased the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? Any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far on the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current fire that we've been going through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [6]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think we have learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or for a Prime Day than it is to get ready for something like this when everything hits at once, high demand and then also a need to restock automatically and not prepare for it. So that's not something we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for -- and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime -- excuse me, Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, we're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our Prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, the first-time viewers nearly doubled, which is, I think, a good time for people to -- when they're -- a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained and see our video collection.

It's also beyond kind of Prime Video, it's also our channels and video rentals also went up as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw it as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using it -- people using Alexa Calling and Drop In. So I think the Prime story is that shopping is really important for people now, especially when they -- those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they're handling the additional demand, and it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator [7]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst [8]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two, please. First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies, the way you track it? Pre-COVID, Amazon was able to had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand and where you are in terms of the recovery. In other words, when are you going to be -- how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one is can you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected -- maybe the growth rate is really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate is -- what are you seeing there in terms of -- I assume there's much greater usage of AWS now. Is that something that would show up in the P&L maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1 on such a large base. Again, we're -- now it's a $41 billion run rate, and that's grown 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing kind of post-COVID is it varies by industry. I think -- we think what is -- probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers. There's millions of active customers from start-ups to enterprises to public sector. So there's a lot of variance and, again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment, all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries. And of course, this would be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly. So right now, we're -- we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job with that, I believe.

On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you're talking about 1-day probably is the heart of your question, when will we get back to what we have seen in levels of 1-day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. And we had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from 1 to 4 days and then further on nonessential items. Had to restrict things that were coming into the warehouses and focus on essential products. So we think that is still the -- was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of nonessential items and the speeding up of 1-day shipments.

I will explain a bit on the 1-day shipping cost because it's aligned with this. So we had originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on 1-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's -- in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to shift things 2-day, 3-day, 4-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our 1-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for 1-day shipping, things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in. All those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have, and we're glad we've made that investment. But we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers.

So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's just it's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will -- when we do that, we'll see a resumption of more 1-day service. But right now, things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or at what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heath Patrick Terry, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD [11]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call, they mentioned that they had seen 2 years' worth of digital transformation in the cloud in 2 months. I'm curious if you -- how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into August or into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this is, what this has meant for AWS and the adoption of the -- rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter, if we adjust for that, that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter-over-quarter. Any sense of -- or any sense that you can sort of share with us of just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the 1-day investments and the efficiencies that you're seeing there versus anything else in particular that you would call out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. So first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments that -- you may have heard also about digital transformation. I think what I would say is we've continued to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage, not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build. And I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the largest -- most functionality, the largest in those vibrant community of customers and partners, having really proven operational and security experience and building what customers need in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other really key areas is -- has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we're seeing different performance in different industries, but our sales force is still there to help not only with current capacity but also to transition to new and -- as people make that journey on to the cloud and then expand their use of the cloud.

On the $4 billion -- or sorry, on the Q2 guidance, I think the question is, perhaps if -- how do we have a range that's above 0 if we have $4 billion of cost, is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there's -- there are some efficiencies that we'd leverage, that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are -- you get more capability, both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have -- again, pretty much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there, and there are some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to -- we believe, we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in the, I would say, in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But certainly, the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant.

On the 1-day, I would remind you that the 1-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past 4 quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the -- remember the impact of our change in the useful life of our servers mostly hitting in the AWS business. That was an $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1, and that will continue into the rest of the year. And that, again, is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, and it's both a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets or recognize that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it remaining from here on out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [13]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. And just to add to that, too, I think it's about $800 million or nearly $800 million benefit in the first quarter. We do expect the change to decrease as the year progresses, keep that in mind.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eric James Sheridan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst [15]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe 2, if I can. One on demand and the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter-in-place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus the U.S. or Asia and the U.S. or India in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? I'm curious what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation. The cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. I wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in your overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [16]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Sorry, Eric. I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly, we would look to see lower shipping costs, although I would -- a lot of -- I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition with the airplanes. There's things that we do on long-haul trucking and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. And we've -- but we haven't quantified that or not for -- it's in our guidance, but I can't break it out for you right now. On the -- how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say, in the types of products that people are buying and the stay-at-home restrictions and the -- so it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries on when it's hitting certain countries and when it's -- maybe when it's -- where they are in their curve and flattening their curve and all that.

I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India where, of course, we -- similar to all companies in India, we were -- we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering. And we will further expand when the Indian government announces that we're allow to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern, except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because it essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also a different experience than the other countries internationally.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [18]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. A couple. Just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their Subscribe & Save. Anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories? And the second thing, for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [19]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin, it's Dave. Yes. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I'd certainly point to grocery. If you look at the -- as a reminder, the online grocery is up on our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores. But we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping, and we have a number of ways for customers to do that, Prime Now, Fresh and then, of course, Whole Foods online for delivery or pickup. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand, so that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up -- Whole Food stores that offer pickup capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150. So a lot of work being done there.

On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there, it increased year-over-year about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's, again, similar that you saw a lot of folks that were, when stay-at-home measures were not yet in place, were shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time, more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. Still a lot of work being done there, both in -- for the workers that are doing the delivery and the workers that are in the stores, a lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy and able to accommodate customers and make sure customers are comfortable however they choose to shop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [20]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I'd add to that, Justin. I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people accustomed to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through music, video, Alexa, certainly, communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team, and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with their Prime memberships.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [21]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. And then second half of the quarter, are you assuming kind of we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [22]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, we are heavily constrained -- again, it's an odd quarter because generally, the biggest uncertainty we have is customer demand and what they'll order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong. And the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that -- the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find nonessential items, increasing marketing and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. Top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually, things that you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted and in this quarter, you can't. And that's really where the uncertainty is driven.

Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Crédit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stephen D. Ju, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director [24]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. So Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number kind of jumps around a little bit. But is this primarily a matter of the constrained delivery resources and, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ongoing supply chain concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first-party perspective or from what the third-party sellers may be calling out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [25]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks -- I've talked about testing, but that's not something that we resell. But -- so there's -- there are a lot of supply chain concerns mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just -- the first question...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stephen D. Ju, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director [26]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations? Or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably a limited delivery resources on the heightened demand?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [27]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything, it's we're prioritizing essential items. And a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area, tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that, that is the reason that FDA would have not been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, though, to -- and sellers are taking that opportunity to ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse, obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouses as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's -- the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important. And we're very grateful to our third-party sellers because they've been through a lot as well.

Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

John Ryan Blackledge, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Head of Internet Research, MD and Senior Research Analyst [29]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated, could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter, if possible? And then in the release, you indicated more -- potentially more hiring above the 175,000 head count additions. Any way to quantify? And does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [30]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Sure. Let me start with that second one. I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce -- as we change any thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now, we've fully hired the 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising, what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. And your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account. The majority is revenue, but there's other -- some other things. What I can tell you underneath it is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and impact it's -- positive impact it's had on customer selection.

But we did start to see some impact in March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price. But advertisers continue to advertise at a high clip. It wasn't as noticeable as maybe with some others we're seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have, again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have -- a large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which -- off-site which may have been disproportionately impacted, at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well, and it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising or their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value as it has in the past.

The company's one-day shipping promise has fallen by the wayside amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But that doesn't mean Prime members aren't getting value from their memberships. On the contrary, Amazon's management says it's seen a lot of pickup in members using all of the benefits that come with Prime, including unlimited shipping.

""We see our Prime customers are shopping more often, and they have larger basket sizes,"" CFO Brian Olsavsky said on Amazon's first-quarter earnings call. ""We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits,"" he added.

With Prime members seeing increased value from the program, we should see an increase in Prime subscription services revenue in the second quarter as Amazon attracts additional members and improves retention for existing members.

A look at the first quarter

Amazon saw subscription revenue grow 29% year over year last quarter after adjusting for changes in foreign exchange rates. That's a slowdown from previous quarters, but that's to be expected as Prime membership grows bigger and nears its saturation point in some of Amazon's biggest markets.

It's important to keep in mind that the U.S. -- Amazon's biggest market -- was relatively slow to put stay-at-home orders in place. So, COVID-19-inspired consumer behavior only impacted a couple weeks of Amazon's first-quarter results. Since Amazon accounts for Prime membership revenue equally over the life of the subscription, that means it saw minimal impact from new memberships, especially considering it offers a free trial.

That said, there were some clear impacts. Physical store sales increased 8% year over year as shoppers flocked to Whole Foods in late February and early March in order to stock up. (Olsavsky expects that growth to wane in the second quarter without as much hoarding behavior.) Online sales also accelerated in the first quarter, climbing 24% year over year.

If store sales are a leading indicator of Prime subscription revenue growth, Amazon should see strong growth in subscription services revenue in the second quarter.

Amazon's Prime challenges

The two biggest challenges Amazon has faced in growing Prime subscriptions over the last couple of years are declining conversion rates from trial memberships and increased subscriber churn rates due to the monthly membership option.

Historically, Amazon has seen higher trial conversions and member retention from members who also engage with Prime Video and other digital benefits. To that end, Olsavsky pointed out that first-time Prime Video viewers doubled in March.

Olsavsky also said Prime Channels -- additional OTT services Prime members can subscribe to -- saw an uptick in subscriptions and viewership. As did digital downloads and rentals. Both should contribute to higher retention rates as well.

Is Amazon pulling Prime memberships forward?

While Amazon is seeing great engagement from its Prime members, and it's likely seeing an uptick in new memberships, it may be merely pulling forward members that would've eventually signed up later in the year.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) management poignantly said the surge in subscribers it saw in the first quarter likely means slower subscriber growth later in the year. ""The person who didn't join Netflix during the entire confinement is not likely to join soon after the confinement,"" management wrote in its letter to shareholders.

Amazon might have a slightly different experience than its fellow FAANG stock, though. The person signing up to gain access to Prime Now grocery delivery amid stay-at-home orders may be different than the person signing up for Prime later this year for exclusive access to holiday shopping deals and faster shipping.

Unfortunately, Amazon may not experience its typical mid-year surge in Prime membership signups, as it's delaying Prime Day. So, while not every new Prime member Amazon is signing up these days may be a pull-forward from later in the year, Amazon may still see depressed signups compared to a year ago in the third quarter. Investors should instead look to see if Amazon is able to retain the subscribers signing up and stick with Prime today through the dog days of summer, even without Prime Day."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-services-demand-soars-coronavirus-121812695.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T12:18:12+00:00,"Microsoft Corp. MSFT on May 8 said that it will create its first datacenter in Italy under a $1.5 billion investment. With this, the company continues to expand its cloud services business across the world. The news comes a couple of days after the tech giant said that it would pump in $1 billion in Poland to create a datacenter and expand its cloud services there.

Could business has been gaining popularity lately and the COVID-19 pandemic is making its importance felt further with countries under lockdown and more people working and learning from home. This has seen the world becoming cloud-dependent and companies shifting data and information to technological and digital platforms to safely remain afloat.

Microsoft Emphasizing Cloud Service

Microsoft, which is one of the market leaders in cloud service, said that it will expand its cloud computing service in Italy with a new datacenter. The Italian cloud market is poised to grow at a double-digit pace over the next few years.

Italy has embraced smartworking following the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts believe that the country will increasingly rely on digital processes for their business. Also, last week, Microsoft announced a $1 billion investment in cloud computing service in Poland over the next few years. In February, Microsoft announced plans of opening a datacenter region in Spain. Microsoft already has 60 cloud regions around the world.

Cloud Business Booming

Not only Microsoft, could services have become the focus for a large number of tech companies thanks to the ongoing pandemic.

Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN also opened a datacenter region in Italy last week. A number of companies are expecting their cloud usage to exceed plans due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the ninth-annual Flexera 2020 State of the Cloud Report, 59% of the companies expect their cloud usage to be slightly or significantly higher than planned.

Last month, Zoom Video Communications, Inc.’s ZM Zoom teamed up with Oracle Corporation ORCL to expand its cloud business.Oracle has also been ramping up free online learning and certification courses amid this lockdown. Also, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd BABA recently announced that it will invest approximately $28 billion over the next three years on its cloud infrastructure, focusing on technologies including operating system, servers, chips and network.

Our Choices

Tech companies have been aggressively expanding their cloud services, given that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over and many governments are still hesitant to lift lockdown or ease stay-at-home orders. Given the situation, we have shortlisted four tech companies that are sure to benefit from soaring demand for cloud services.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covid-19-changing-entertainment-five-120029434.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T12:00:29+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors are almost through the first coronavirus-wrecked earnings season, and the message from the leading entertainment companies is that things will get worse before they get better. If there's a silver lining, it may be that the pandemic is also providing a clearer picture of the future of entertainment consumption, and it substantiates the industry’s costly plans to go all-in on streaming platforms.

The most telling number that came out of earnings in recent weeks was 91%. That’s how much net income plunged at Walt Disney Co., one of the most time-tested, resilient companies in the world. Regional lockdowns have taken aim at all of Disney’s core businesses, most notably its theme parks around the world, which have been closed to visitors for weeks. But the TV and film operations at Disney’s rivals are also hurting. In fact, Netflix Inc. is the only media giant that doesn’t have revenue tied to advertising, live sports or people leaving their houses, and it’s the only industry stock that's been left unscathed:

Explosive demand for TV content led almost 16 million people to sign up for Netflix — more than double what the company predicted before the Covid-19 outbreak. The extended time at home also has been a chance for consumers to take new apps out for a spin, including Disney+, Apple TV+, Quibi and Comcast Corp.’s Peacock. Disney+ has added 28 million subscribers since December. Meanwhile, as the recession causes consumers to tighten their budgets, pricey cable-TV bills will be on the chopping block. Already last quarter, the big four pay-TV providers saw an exodus of nearly 2 million customers, with AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV accounting for almost half of those cancellations:

The desire to save money is boosting interest in free streaming-video services, such as Pluto TV and Tubi, that are funded by advertisers. Pluto TV’s growth proved to be the biggest bright spot in ViacomCBS Inc.’s quarterly results, as the cancellation of the NCAA March Madness tournament crushed traditional network ad sales:

Without sports, consumers are dusting off their gaming consoles and playing for hours on end. Verizon Communications Inc. said that while video usage on its internet network was up 40%, that’s nothing compared to the 200% increase in gaming. Like social-media apps, online gaming can provide a sense of community — something streaming-TV apps may aspire to do one day but don’t yet. In-game purchases are also extending the life of games, and they’ve become a money gusher during the lockdown for publishers such as Electronic Arts Inc.:

It remains to be seen if, after all that time spent gaming and streaming from the couch, consumers will be itching to go to the movies once again. Even as some states begin to reopen business, it won't be possible to gauge any recovery for the movie-theater industry just yet because the year’s biggest films have been postponed:

The same uncertainty hangs over theme parks. Disney plans to reopen its Shanghai park next week to a relatively small number of visitors. Normally, that resort’s capacity is 80,000 guests, but the local government is allowing just 30% of that, and Disney is capping ticket sales at even less at first. With face masks and temperature checks, and no more hugs from your favorite character, it’ll be a test of whether consumers still see Disney as a magical place to escape the real world — or a sad reminder of what it's become. Some may choose to just stay home and stream.

The coronavirus crisis has played to the strengths of tech companies: People are staying indoors, increasingly using the internet and streaming more video than ever.

It’s clear that the tech giants are well positioned to make it through the crisis relatively intact. “Alphabet [Google’s parent], and Amazon will be just fine,” says Tal Chalozin, co-founder and chief technical officer of ad-tech company Innovid.

The crisis stands to make the most powerful tech companies even stronger, as they have business models built for digital marketplaces and the cash reserves to withstand an economic downturn, Chalozin says, adding, “It definitely is going to make the bigger players bigger.”

That’s not to say a recession precipitated by COVID-19 will be good for any business. Double-digit unemployment in the U.S. will weigh on consumer spending (and by extension advertising) across the board.

And Big Tech isn’t immune from the fallout. In reporting first-quarter 2020 earnings, Google and Facebook saw ad spending fall off a cliff in March, but both companies said that the numbers stabilized going into April. Apple’s hardware sales for the first three months of 2020 were down — but the services business, which includes App Store sales, surged to an all-time high of $13.3 billion for the period, up 17%.

Amazon sales boomed in the first quarter to an eye-popping $75.4 billion, up 26% year over year, on overwhelming demand from stay-at-home customers. At the same time, the crisis is taking a big toll on the bottom line. CEO Jeff Bezos said Amazon will spend roughly its first-quarter operating profit of $4 billion — or more — on costs related to COVID-19 in the second quarter.

“The current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon’s business as never before,” Bezos said in prepared remarks addressing the first-quarter results, “but it’s also the hardest time we’ve ever faced.”

Whereas companies in Hollywood and other industry sectors are slashing staff or furloughing employees, tech players say they are still hiring through 2020, though at a slower pace than previously projected. “With our strong financial position and the important social value our services provide, we’re planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year,” Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told analysts last week.

The ad businesses of Facebook, Google and Amazon will definitely weather the storm — and not all of their competitors will, says Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at market research firm eMarketer. The pullback will only get worse in the near term, she predicts. For example, video ad spending could decline as much as 21% year over year in the second quarter, according to her forecasts. That could mean more M&A in the sector. “Overall, it points to probably more consolidation in the digital ad market later this year or into 2021,” she says.

Meanwhile, digital entertainment is getting a massive adrenaline shot because of the health crisis, with virtually all theaters shut down nationwide. Netflix reeled in a record 15.7 million subscribers in the first quarter, though execs believe the torrid pace won’t continue through the rest of 2020. On another front, Universal’s direct-to-streaming “Trolls World Tour” in its first three weeks of release pulled in almost $100 million — a record for a digital-only movie — and those transactions went through platforms owned by Apple, Amazon, Google and NBCUniversal’s Fandango along with those of pay-TV operators.

“At this moment in time, Netflix and large streaming services are much better positioned than film production companies,” says Michelle Wroan, KPMG’s media industry leader in the U.S. “The eyeballs are in the home.”

It remains to be seen in the post-COVID-19 reality who the winners and losers will be. Wroan believes theaters and live events will rebound eventually. “Humans are social beings,” she says. “There’s pent-up demand to be social” — by which she means in real life, not on Facebook.

On the other hand, the pandemic is training consumers to satisfy their entertainment diets without setting foot outside the house. That bodes well for traditional media companies that have shifted to direct-to-streaming models, and not a moment too soon amid life in quarantine. Disney already has a hit in Disney Plus, and WarnerMedia hopes HBO Max will make a splash later this month.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-coronavirus-lockdowns-are-boosting-netflix-but-leaving-hulu-lagging-behind-142530951.html,AAPL,2020-05-09T14:25:30+00:00,"Streaming platforms are benefiting from coronavirus lockdown orders — and quarantined families may be contributing most to the boom.

Hub Entertainment Research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers during the month of April who watch at least one hour of TV per week, recently found that 94% of self-isolating families with children pay for at least one streaming subscription. Yet that number dips to 82% for those self-isolating without kids, and falls even further for those not self-isolating and with no children at home.

(Source: Hub Entertainment Research, data collected in April 2020) More

To put those numbers in perspective, out of all Hub’s respondents, 78% said they own at least one streaming platform in 2020, which is six percentage points higher than 2019’s results. It backs recent evidence that suggests stay-at-home measures are bolstering interest in streaming, which are then translating into subscription buys.

The data gets more interesting when Hub drilled down into exactly which platforms got the most benefit. Netflix (NFLX) — which just reported a big surge in subscribers — led the way amongst quarantined families with 83%, followed by Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) and Disney+ (DIS).

Meanwhile, Hulu lagged in popularity with just 41% — and tellingly, Apple’s (AAPL) nascent Plus service didn’t appear to make the cut.

(Source: Hub Entertainment Research, data collected in April 2020) More

“What our study shows is exactly where they’re turning to fill their newly found viewing time—primarily to streaming services that offer a combination of exclusive originals, family-friendly titles, and older shows that can provide a bit of nostalgic solace during this unprecedented and stressful time,” Peter Fondulas, principal at Hub and co-author of the study, said in a statement.

Netflix checks most of those boxes from strong originals like “Ozark” and “Stranger Things,” to more classic titles like “The Office” and “Gilmore Girls.”

Netflix originals from ""Ozark"" to ""Stranger Things"" are attracting consumers as stay-at-home mandates push viewers to streaming. More

One streamer that seems to be falling behind is Disney-owned Hulu. In a separate study conducted by 7Park Data, Hulu also struggled to match its competitors — with average household minutes dropping for the month of April despite stay-at-home restrictions.

Meanwhile, Netflix once again dominated the space, securing the most viewing minutes for the month with consumers spending 50% more time on the platform compared to January, according to 7Park.

But the competition will soon be heating up with HBO Max (T) entering the streaming wars at the end of May — and the platform is leaning on some serious star power to help drum up some buzz.

Earlier this week, HBO Max revealed that pop star and actress Selena Gomez will be hosting a quarantine cooking show, as the streamer looks for creative ways to generate content amid the coronavirus.

Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP), the security software company warned in a blog post that hackers are using all three video platforms to attempt to steal identities and engage in other nefarious activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It makes sense. Hackers follow the users, and with shelter in place orders being enforced around the country and millions of people working from home, collaboration platform usage is skyrocketing. That provides a fertile breeding ground for cybercriminals.

According to Check Point, in the last three weeks about 2,500 Zoom-related domains were registered on the Internet, with 1.5% actually malicious and 13% appearing to be suspicious. ""Since January 2020 to date, a total of 6,576 Zoom-related domains have been registered globally,"" wrote Check Point in the blog. ""And Zoom isn't the only platform cybercriminals are impersonating – both Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have been used to lure victims too.""

Some of the emails seemingly from the tech stocks that people have fallen victim to include subject lines that read ""You have been added to a team in Microsoft Teams"" with a fake link that looks real but really downloads malware in the background. Check Point also found fake Google Meet domains that sent people to malicious websites.

The World Health Organization is also being used by hackers to scam people during the pandemic. Check Point said cybercriminals have sent malicious emails with subject lines that purportedly provide information about vaccine tests and results but really contain the AgentTesla malware."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-essential-industries-aren-t-145147113.html,FB,2020-05-08T14:51:47+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid the worst jobs report in the history of jobs reports, a few industries actually added jobs from mid-March to mid-April.

“General merchandise stores including warehouse clubs and supercenters” is the North American Industry Classification System category for Walmarts, Targets, Dollar Trees, Sam’s Clubs, Costcos and such. It seems likely that supermarkets also saw job gains, but for them and most other industry subcategories employment is reported with a one month lag, so we won’t know until the next jobs report. Food and beverage stores, the supersector that includes supermarkets, saw a 42,000-job seasonally adjusted decline in employment in April.

Among the other job-gaining sectors, “other information services” may require some explanation. About 80% of its jobs are at “Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,” which covers the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. The remainder are at other digital information providers such as, well, the publisher of Bloomberg Opinion. “Couriers and messengers” is FedEx, United Parcel Service and their ilk.

One thing that stands out here is that the job gains are really, really tiny compared with the 20.5 million jobs lost. We may well see a more significant shift of employment into pandemic-resistant or pandemic-fighting sectors in the coming months, but that takes a while. And given that the shifts in demand that have had everybody lining up at Costco for toilet paper are not (one hopes) permanent, such companies are unlikely to go overboard with hiring.

Another thing that stands out is that a lot of sectors that would seem to be quite essential in a pandemic nonetheless shed jobs. I’ve listed a selection here, ranked by percentage job losses rather than the absolute numbers because that seemed more informative.

Other health-care sectors were even harder hit as almost all non-coronavirus-related care was put on hold for the month, with employment down 15.2% at ambulatory health-care services and 52.5% at dentists’ offices. Then again, a lot of those jobs ought to return quickly as well, although things are definitely going to be tough for dentists and dental hygienists, whose work probably entails more intense coronavirus risk than any other.

The bigger message here may just be that a U.S. economy that is pared down to “essentials” isn’t much of an economy. Here’s hoping we all start doing a lot more nonessential (but also non-virus-spreading) things soon.

(FB) missed earnings per share (EPS) estimates when it reported results after the closing bell on April 29. The stock gapped higher on April 30 and moved above its monthly pivot at $202.60 as May began. The upside potential is to its semiannual risky level at $225.99, which would be a new all-time high if tested.

The social media giant has missed EPS estimates in two of the past four quarters, mainly on warnings related to advertising income. The stock is not cheap, as its P/E ratio is elevated at 28.94 without offering a dividend, according to Macrotrends.

The stock ended last week at $212.35, up just 3.5% year to date and in bull market territory at 54.9% above its March 18 low of $137.10. The stock is 5.3% below its all-time intraday high of $224.20 set on Jan. 29.

The daily chart for Facebook

Refinitiv XENITH

The daily chart for Facebook shows that the stock had been above a golden cross since April 3, when the 50-day simple moving average rose above the 200-day simple moving average to indicate that higher prices lie ahead. The stock slipped to a test of its 200-day simple moving average at $161.33 on June 3, 2019, as a buying opportunity. The 200-day simple moving average was tested again at $175.30 on Oct. 2 as another buying opportunity.

The stock set its all-time intraday high of $224.20 on Jan. 29 in anticipation of a positive earnings report released after the close that day. Good news was priced into this beat, and the stock gapped lower on Jan. 30. This price gap was filled on strength on Feb. 20.

Facebook stock then crashed below its 50-day simple moving average on Feb. 24 and then below the 200-day simple moving average on March 4. This led to the March 18 low of $137.10.

The V-shaped bottom for the stock resulted in a test of the quarterly risky level at $188.32 and then a test of the May risky level at $202.60 on May 1. The upside potential is now to its semiannual risky level at $225.49.

The weekly chart for Facebook

Refinitiv XENITH

The weekly chart for Facebook is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $189.23. The stock is also above its 200-week simple moving average, or reversion to the mean, at $166.25. This average provided a buying opportunity between the weeks of March 13 and April 10.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 57.23 last week, up from 46.38 on May 1. At the January high, this reading was above 90.00, which put the stock in an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, and bubbles always pop.

Trading strategy: Buy Facebook shares on weakness to the monthly and quarterly value levels at $202.60 and $188.31, and reduce holdings on strength to the semiannual risky level at $225.49.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.

The second quarter 2020 level was established based upon the March 31 close, and the monthly level for May was established based upon the April 30 close. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week, and new quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year, while annual levels remain in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered ""too cheap to ignore,"" which is typically followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months."

“It’s been the small caps that actually outperformed percentage wise last week, and a big part of the reason is that there are a bunch of stocks in that area that are really, I think going to be the ones to look at as we see this seismic shift that's happened because of the pandemic,” says Michele Schneider, MarketGauge director of trading education and research, told Yahoo Finance.

Schneider says small cap companies with strong earnings and good financials can “fill the void” in a behavioral shift that’s happening as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Which would be where the change is in technology, where the change is in everything that we do,” said Schneider. “How we consume, how we shop, how we go to restaurants, go to the movies, how we travel.”

“Some of the classic stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), et cetera, they're kind of almost pre-historic in a way in that they are saturated mathematically. You wonder how much more they have to go,” she added.

Schneider is also bullish on silver [SI=F], gold [GC=F] and other commodities, given the risk of stagflation in the future.

“We haven't quite gotten there yet [stagflation], but I do believe very strongly that that's a distinct possibility going forward,” said Schneider. “I'm looking at it more end of this year, maybe into 2021. We already started accumulating positions for that.”

Stagflation is commonly defined as persistent high inflation along with high unemployment and a stagnant economy. The term became popular in the U.S. during the 1970s when oil prices surged during rampant inflation and high unemployment.

Schneider notes similarities between both periods, with the exception of oil prices.

“I do believe that we're in a situation where we can keep the recessionary environment, and see these agriculturals — we're already seeing reflected a bit in gold and the miners — start going up,” said Schneider.

Gold exchange-traded funds have attracted $14.5 billion in less than five months, according to Bloomberg data. The 2020 inflows into ETF’s tracking gold surpass any full year on record, even as stocks have rallied since their March 52-week lows.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-releases-ai-based-enterprise-094139102.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T09:41:39+00:00,"On Monday, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched Kendra, an enterprise search solution powered by machine learning.

What Happened

Kendra, which utilizes machine learning, will be useful for enterprises looking to index internal data sources and make them searchable. Kendra users can deploy language queries, and Kendra returns the most relevant results in the form of a precise answer or document.

Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President Amazon Machine Learning, AWS said in a statement, “Our customers often tell us that search in their organizations is difficult to implement, slows down productivity, and frequently doesn't work because their data is scattered across many silos in many formats.”

Sivasubramanian claimed Kendra would empower employees at organizations “with highly accurate, machine learning-powered enterprise search, which makes it easier for them to find the answers they seek across the full wealth of an organization's data.""

Why It Matters

According to AWS, enterprise search is difficult to implement, as the underlying data is unstructured and spread across different data sources. Search is usually done through keywords and not natural language queries, and these keywords can be spread across multiple documents in differing contexts generating random results.

AWS’s Kendra is industry-specific, and its usability spans IT, healthcare, and insurance. Industrial, energy, financial services, legal, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, human resources, news, telecommunications, mining, food, and beverage and automotive will be added in the second half of this year.

The target of enterprise search has been to operate like Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google, but AWS’s Kendra would give any company operating in a supported industry a head start in search because the search engine would understand language specific to the industry. Kendra search boxes can be inserted into websites or applications and would support features like type ahead.

The addition of AI and machine learning would boost enterprise search significantly, reported Techcrunch.

Price Action

On Monday, Amazon shares closed 1.24% higher at $2,409.

As if the coronavirus pandemic weren’t enough to give people nightmares this year, headlines about giant Asian “murder hornets” landing in the U.S. for the first time have had some people musing that the end is nigh.

The flying, meat-eating insects that grow more than 2 inches long can kill up to 50 people a year in Japan, and are known to decimate bee hives.

But all hope is not yet lost: tales of plucky bugs fighting back have been gaining a lot of buzz on social media.

A pretty gory video of a praying mantis grabbing a murder hornet from behind, and then chewing its face off and eating its brain, has gone viral across Twitter TWTR, -1.81% , Facebook FB, -1.44% and reddit, leading “praying mantis” to trend on Twitter on Thursday. Watch it here, but be warned that it’s pretty graphic.

It’s gruesome stuff, but many viewers cheered the mantis for taking down the Asian giant hornet notorious for decapitating bees and wiping out entire honeybee hives in a matter of hours. The hornets also produce a potent venom in their long stingers that reportedly feels like a hot nail being driven into one’s flesh when people get stung by them. A grisly 2018 video shows a murder hornet killing a mouse in seconds.

This is really more of an underdog story, however, as National Geographic warned in 2002 that “bees, other hornet species, and larger insects such as praying mantises are no match for the giant hornets, which often stalk their prey in relentless armies.” (The same article notes that murder hornet venom is strong enough to “disintegrate human flesh.”)

Related:Giant ‘murder hornet’ is in U.S. to stay, will eventually reach East Coast, experts say

Of course, the praying mantis is also known for being a cunning hunter in its own right, eating everything from bees, moths, beetles and crickets to even small birds, like hummingbirds.

And the female mantis is notorious for occasionally cannibalizing her male partner after mating.

A photograph of Japanese honeybees fighting back against a murder hornet is also making the rounds online. Turns out, these honeybees can form “hot defensive bee balls” by swarming a giant hornet and vibrating their flight muscles all at once, which “cooks the hornet to death.”

Meanwhile, a 4-year-old llama named Winter may hold the key to fighting the coronavirus in her blood. Behold nature in all of its beauty."

Google (GOOGL) - Get Report is extending its work-from-home mandate until the end of the year for most employees, according to reports. The tech giant will begin reopening its global offices as early as June, but is targeting between 10% and 15% capacity at a time, and plans to institute precautionary measures.

“We’re starting to really get the hang of these virtual meetings, though I do miss the experience of having so many of us in the same place,” Alphabet CEO Pichai wrote in an all-staff email seen by CNBC. “It may be awhile before that’s possible. Our ramp back to the office will be slow, deliberate and incremental.”

Starting in June, the tech giant may either take a staggered approach or allow employees to rotate coming into the office. Pichai’s email also indicated that some offices in Asia are operating at 30% capacity, “given where they are in their stage of dealing with this epidemic.”

Facebook (FB) - Get Report appears to be taking a similar approach. The social network said this week that employees who can work from home will be permitted to do so through the end of the year. Facebook was among the first major companies to ask employees to work from home as the pandemic spread in the U.S. in March.

The company is still deciding which staffers can return to its offices.

The tech giants may help set the tone for others in corporate America as they establish new work arrangements. And according to the latest jobless numbers, jobs that couldn't be done from home were among the hardest hit, while financial, professional services and information jobs reported lower than average joblessness.

Even as offices begin to reopen for some employees, analysts anticipate that the remote-work trend will stick around for awhile longer.

Not all major companies are following suit, however.

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report is planning to reopen its Fremont, Calif.-based main factory, days after CEO Elon Musk dubbed the stay-at-home orders “fascist” on an earnings call and likened the health measures to an assault on freedom.

But officials in Alameda County, where Tesla’s factory is based, said that the facility had not been cleared for reopening. Regional leaders recently extended the stay-at-home order in six counties, but are permitting some lower-risk businesses to reopen along with precautionary measures.

Companies have moved away from brick and mortar to predominantly online services as a result of ubiquitous Internet access. In this shift, online companies reduce overhead costs, including rent and wages, associated with operating a physical store.

While online retailers are more convenient, purchases of goods and services are subject to additional shipping and handling charges incurred by the consumer. Even though technology has transformed a number of industries over the past 10 years, shipping and postage have remained relatively unchanged. Traditional postal service providers such as USPS, UPS (UPS), and FedEx (FDX) have remained the primary source of shipping and handling for major online retailers.

Recently, Amazon (AMZN) has challenged the status quo with Amazon Prime Air. Amazon Prime Air is a drone delivery system that anticipates package deliveries in 30 minutes or less. The program has not been executed as yet but is currently in development.

While the financial and economic impact of drones is robust, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) regulations in conjunction with privacy and safety concerns have delayed the launch of commercial drone services.

Regulations

Amazon’s efforts to launch unmanned aerial delivery systems have been delayed as a result of FAA regulations. Currently, drones in the U.S. are sanctioned for military, research, and recreational use. Military drones are not subject to the same regulations as those used for research and recreation.

At the moment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the U.S. are regulated up to a height of 400 feet of airspace in populated areas. Commercial use of drones has not been sanctioned by the FAA and is currently illegal. With concerns about air space and ground safety, the FAA is reluctant to provide licenses allowing companies to test drone services within the United States.

Amazon’s inability to research aerial delivery within U.S. borders has led the ecommerce leader to test this new technology in the United Kingdom, with successful tests run in Cambridge, England, in 2016. In 2015, the FAA did provide Amazon with permission to test current models of drones, but by then Amazon had also been testing in Canada.

One of the main setbacks to drone use for commercial activity is the FAA's rule requiring ""line of sight."" This rule requires a drone operator to have the drone in their line of sight at all times, which defeats the purpose of using drones commercially, especially for deliveries.

Economic Impact

Rapid technological innovation has provided consumers cutting-edge products at affordable prices. Traditionally, drones had been limited to military use due to high costs and technical sophistication. However, due to economies of scale, consumers can purchase drones for less than $100.

With widespread access, consumer companies such as Amazon have explored the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes. Amazon Prime Air has promised a 30-minute delivery service for packages of up to 5 lbs. Google (GOOG), in altruistic contrast to Amazon, has developed aerial drones for environmental conservation and delivery of medicine to remote locations.

The environmental impact is also immense. Powered by batteries, drones are more environmentally friendly than delivery trucks. If delivery drones gain widespread usage, this would reduce the reliance on vehicles for many companies. This would have an adverse impact on automobile manufacturers, but the impact on the environment would be a boon and would help many countries reduce emissions, helping meet emissions targets set in various global agreements.

The economic implications of commercial drone use are undeniable. The market for drones is estimated to be $127 billion across a variety of industries. Notably, the commercial use of drones will predominantly affect agriculture and infrastructure more so than commerce. Due to the ability to cover large areas, drone use in agriculture is anticipated to effectively feed and hydrate plants while also limiting exposure to diseases.

On a macroeconomic scale, the integration of UAVs could create more than 100,000 jobs. Over a 10-year span, job creation from commercial drone use will consist primarily of manufacturing jobs and drone operators. Likewise, states will benefit from tax windfalls, stemming from increased economic activity.

The implications clearly have a positive impact on businesses and consumers. Consumers directly benefit from job creation, resulting in additional earnings. Commercial drones will also allow industries to realize savings from cost-effective means of inventory, transportation, and distribution. These cost savings can be passed down to the consumer through a reduction in prices.

Disadvantages

While the financial implications of drone use are robust, numerous consumers, states, and regulators believe sanctioned UAV use to be detrimental. 44 states have passed their own laws on drone usage for commercial, recreational, and public use. Widespread use of drones is anticipated to increase privacy concerns among citizens nervous about corporate and government data collection. Amazon drones utilize a camera and GPS to navigate delivery destinations, which many believe to be intrusive.

Furthermore, drone delivery services offered by Amazon and other companies will face logistical roadblocks. Traditional postal services maintain the liability of damaged or stolen property incurred in the delivery process. However, without human monitoring, a drone is unable to ensure seamless deliveries. Likewise, deliveries in major cities are bound to encounter numerous issues. Accessing apartment units within city skyscrapers is an insurmountable feat for an unmanned aerial vehicle.

Aside from logistical and privacy concerns, wildlife, such as birds, face higher risks with the greater number of aerial vehicles. The FAA estimates that birds cause more than $1 billion in damages to aircraft in the United States.

The Bottom Line

Amazon’s continued efforts to test and research unmanned aerial vehicles have put pressure on Congress and the FAA to reform drone regulations. The integration of drones into national airspace will not only benefit ecommerce businesses like Amazon but industries such as agriculture, public safety, and natural disaster management, to name a few. In a more altruistic manner, Google anticipates the use of its drones for the delivery of medical products and as a means of protecting the environment."

Google (GOOGL) - Get Report is extending its work-from-home mandate until the end of the year for most employees, according to reports. The tech giant will begin reopening its global offices as early as June, but is targeting between 10% and 15% capacity at a time, and plans to institute precautionary measures.

“We’re starting to really get the hang of these virtual meetings, though I do miss the experience of having so many of us in the same place,” Alphabet CEO Pichai wrote in an all-staff email seen by CNBC. “It may be awhile before that’s possible. Our ramp back to the office will be slow, deliberate and incremental.”

Starting in June, the tech giant may either take a staggered approach or allow employees to rotate coming into the office. Pichai’s email also indicated that some offices in Asia are operating at 30% capacity, “given where they are in their stage of dealing with this epidemic.”

Facebook (FB) - Get Report appears to be taking a similar approach. The social network said this week that employees who can work from home will be permitted to do so through the end of the year. Facebook was among the first major companies to ask employees to work from home as the pandemic spread in the U.S. in March.

The company is still deciding which staffers can return to its offices.

The tech giants may help set the tone for others in corporate America as they establish new work arrangements. And according to the latest jobless numbers, jobs that couldn't be done from home were among the hardest hit, while financial, professional services and information jobs reported lower than average joblessness.

Even as offices begin to reopen for some employees, analysts anticipate that the remote-work trend will stick around for awhile longer.

Not all major companies are following suit, however.

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report is planning to reopen its Fremont, Calif.-based main factory, days after CEO Elon Musk dubbed the stay-at-home orders “fascist” on an earnings call and likened the health measures to an assault on freedom.

But officials in Alameda County, where Tesla’s factory is based, said that the facility had not been cleared for reopening. Regional leaders recently extended the stay-at-home order in six counties, but are permitting some lower-risk businesses to reopen along with precautionary measures.

Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has “jumped into action steering Facebook (FB) into a high-profile campaign,” the Wall Street Journal recently wrote after consolidating power on Facebook’s board last December.

Bob Iger, the longtime CEO of Disney (DIS), retired from top management in February, postponing something that he had planned to do for many years. He stayed on as the company’s chair, overseeing his successor Bob Chapek. But after a few weeks, as the New York Times reported, Iger has “smoothly reasserted control.”

The trend was solidified when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos “took back the wheel” at the company, putting a pause on rubbing elbows in Paris with French president Emmanuel Macron and Diane von Furstenberg to go back to day-to-day operations, personally managing the company’s responses to the COVID crisis, the surge in online shopping, and public safety issues.

Not everyone is opting for more control, however. AT&T’s (T) longtime CEO Randall Stephenson announced his retirement on April 24.

CEOs, especially at mega-caps like Amazon, Disney, and Facebook, often delegate much of their tasks to their direct reports, teams, chiefs of staff, much like a government executive. But when things get tough, executives often retrieve the control they’ve ceded and take matters into their own hands.

Leading in crisis

The most common reason for this phenomenon, according to Mary-Hunter McDonnell, a professor in management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, is because people – employees, shareholders, customers – look to decisive and rock-solid leadership during periods of uncertainty, chaos, and fear.

“Even unpopular presidents will see this bump in support and polling,” she said. “I think the same is true in a corporate setting. A CEO, if they’ve taken a step back, needs to be front-stage to rally around.”

Though companies are often governed by committee, executive leadership is key, and people want to believe there’s one person protecting the company and taking it forward.

“Given the extent of the disruption to people’s lives that this pandemic is introducing, everyone in every organization is looking to their leader for what to do next,” said McDonnell. “I know we’re doing it at the University of Pennsylvania and everyone is waiting to hear what they’re supposed to do.“

It’s also a question of morale. As the crisis has raged, over 143 CEOs cut executive pay, with CEOs like Delta’s Ed Bastian leading the way trying to stave off layoffs and lobbying the government for assistance. Employees appreciate when management fights for their benefit.

Morale, McDonnell said, cannot be delegated, so when it’s needed, the CEO’s job is clear-cut.

“When facing stressful events with uncertainty in stressful situations — tender offers, hostile takeovers, changes in control — people are worried about losing jobs, and a CEO's job in those moments is to keep morale high,” she said.

The coronavirus is an exaggerated example.

More than morale

It’s not just a matter people needing a leader in a psychological sense. McDonnell said it’s just as much a matter of efficiency. During crises, the usual operation channels are rattled, turning expected events and processes chaotic."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-covid-19-cases-not-190525056.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T19:05:25+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s global logistics chief Dave Clark, in an interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, said the spread of Covid-19 in the e-commerce giant’s warehouses is no worse than what’s happening in America at large. But when pressed, he declined to provide a total number of cases, making it impossible to independently confirm the company’s assertion.

Clark said the Amazon knows how many cases have afflicted its warehouses but declined to share the total because, he said, “it’s not a particularly useful number.” His comments echo what company spokespeople have been saying for several weeks, prompting workers and officials to press executives to be more forthcoming about illness in their ranks. The latest demand came Tuesday from attorneys general in 12 states and Washington, D.C., who called on Amazon to reveal a state-by-state breakdown of the number of Amazon and Whole Foods workers “who have been infected with and died from Covid-19.”

Public health officials can take swift action when they believe a business is putting workers at risk of exposure. In March, the Kentucky governor temporarily closed an Amazon warehouse that processes returns due to concerns about the spread of Covid-19, and local authorities in Colorado briefly closed a Walmart store near Denver that was linked to the deaths of three people. The coronavirus has ripped through the meat-packing industry, infecting 1% of its workforce and causing at least 20 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Large retailers like Walmart haven’t publicly disclosed coronavirus case totals either, prompting Senator Cory Booker to send the company a letter demanding information about the number of cases, among other things.

Fear is widespread among Amazon workers. In recent weeks, some of the company’s U.S. warehouses have suffered a high rate of absenteeism despite the measures Amazon has taken to make the facilities safer, according to workers interviewed by Bloomberg. Employees have protested and called for the company to be more transparent about not just the number of cases but the deaths of their colleagues, at least six of whom have succumbed. Clark, the public face of the company’s response, has dismissed the protests as the work of a few employees who don’t represent the majority.

Representative Josh Harder, a Modesto, California, Democrat, recently complained to Bezos about Amazon’s lack of transparency. He cited a report that a warehouse worker whose children have compromised immune systems only found out about a positive Covid-19 case at her workplace after asking human resources. In a letter to the Amazon CEO, Harder wrote: “Employees need this information to make vitally important decisions impacting themselves and their families.”

Amazon had an opportunity to communicate more fully when it reported earnings last month. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos extolled his company’s efforts to protect workers, such as purchasing 100 million masks and 31,000 thermometers. He didn’t mention the number of cases. Amazon’s top spokesman Jay Carney dodged the question during an interview on CNN, saying he didn’t have the figure handy. Clark’s 60 Minutes interview went the furthest in explaining why Amazon is unwilling to share the number: because case counts aren’t useful when not compared to the size of the workforce in each Amazon building, or the prevailing infection rate in the surrounding community.

“Our rates of infection are at or below the communities we’re operating in at almost all of our facilities,” Amazon spokeswoman Lisa Levandowski said in a statement. “Anytime there is a confirmed diagnosis we alert every person at the site. This alert to employees is a direct text message noting when the person with the confirmed diagnosis was last in the building—even if it’s been a month or more.”

Still, trust in management, a common sore spot for the company's warehouse workers, has taken a beating in recent weeks. Employees say information about positive cases is sent by text and voicemail to workers in each facility. News about deaths has been shared verbally, with warehouse managers informing small groups. In Amazon's massive warehouses, some of which employ thousands of workers spread across multiple shifts and weekly schedules, the result has been significant delays in workers being told someone they previously worked with has died.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-recruits-elite-academics-lawyers-170742082.html,FB,2020-05-06T20:06:34+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. introduced the initial members of its oversight board, the group that will hear user appeals on content decisions and make binding judgment calls that could go against earlier decisions by the company.

So far, the board includes 20 academics, lawyers, journalists and human rights advocates. The largest social media company created the panel after criticism of Facebook’s extensive power, which is only growing: It has about 3 billion users now.

“Up until now, some of the most difficult decisions have been made by Facebook and you could say Mark Zuckerberg,” Helle Thorning-Schmidt, oversight board co-chair and former prime minister of Denmark, said Wednesday.

Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive officer, has voting control of the company, and has called the board a check on his power -- a way for Facebook to self-regulate, perhaps so governments don’t feel the need to step in. “It’s a huge step for the global community,” Schmidt said.

She’s co-chairing with Jamal Greene of Columbia Law School, who focuses on constitutional rights, Michael McConnell, a constitutional law professor at Stanford Law School, and Catalina Botero-Marino, dean of the Universidad de los Andes Faculty of Law in Bogota.

The co-chairs cautioned that they will only be able to review a few cases, some long after Facebook has made its initial decision.

“We’re going to be selecting a few flowers -- or maybe they’re weeds -- from a field of possibilities,” McConnell said. “We are not the internet police. That isn’t our job. Our job is more to consider appeals, to apply an after-the-fact deliberative second look at this, so as to advance fairness and neutrality in decision-making.” Being a part of the board is a part-time commitment -- an estimated 15 hours per month as the members continue with other roles.

The board will focus on cases from Facebook and Instagram that affect a large number of people or involve a particularly thorny area of Facebook’s policy, so that one decision has a higher impact. The decisions will be made public. The board said it won’t be addressing problems on WhatsApp, since that app is encrypted so board members can’t see what users are saying to each other.

The initial 20 members will select the next 20, while Facebook works on a system for the group to pick out cases to review. The board, which may take months to get up and running, aspires to be a kind of global Supreme Court for the internet. Botero-Marino said it’s better for internet companies to solve their own problems, so governments don’t feel compelled to limit citizens’ free expression online. “In my opinion, this unique board represents a very good model of self-regulation,” she added.

The board decisions will be binding and will not be overturned by Facebook, unless they violate the law, according to the company. The board is funded by a $130 million irrevocable trust, paid for by Facebook, but the company cannot fire any of the board members. Because the board isn’t part of Facebook, it is open to the idea of taking on work from another social media company, such as Twitter Inc., in a few years.

New York, May 12, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has affirmed Match Group, Inc.'s (""Match"" or the ""company"") Ba2 Corporate Family Rating (CFR), Ba2-PD Probability of Default Rating (PDR), Ba1 ratings on the senior secured bank credit facilities and Ba3 ratings on the senior unsecured notes. Concurrently, Moody's assigned a Ba3 rating to the proposed $500 million senior unsecured notes. The outlook was revised to negative from stable.

The terms of the new notes will be substantially similar to Match's existing senior unsecured notes. Net proceeds will be used to fully repay the $400 million 6.375% senior unsecured notes due June 2024, which Moody's expects the company to call. The make-whole cost is estimated at $12.8 million.

Following is a summary of today's rating actions:

..Issuer: Match Group, Inc.

Outlook, Changed to Negative from Stable

On 19 December 2019, Match's parent, IAC/InterActiveCorp (""IAC""), announced that its Board of Directors had approved the separation of IAC and Match into two independent public companies [1]. Under the terms of the spin-off transaction, IAC's shareholders will receive a direct ownership interest in Match proportionate to IAC's existing 81% equity stake in Match. In connection with the transaction, Match will assume IAC's $1.7 billion of unrated exchangeable notes and associated hedging instruments, and pay a $3 per share cash consideration to Match's shareholders and IAC, totaling approximately $850 million in aggregate. The spin-off is expected to close by the end of June 2020.

The rating assignment and affirmations reflect the anticipated pro forma capital structure at transaction closing. Ratings are subject to change should the capital mix be altered at closing. Ratings are also subject to review of final documentation and no material change in the size, terms and conditions of the transaction as advised to Moody's. The transaction is leverage neutral since Moody's expects Match to use the net proceeds to repay the 6.375% notes and supplement cash balances with the excess. Moody's views the transaction favorably given the extension of the debt maturity structure and expected lower annual interest expense. Moody's will withdraw the Ba3 rating on the 6.375% notes upon their full redemption.

RATINGS RATIONALE

The negative outlook reflects the impact that the novel coronavirus (a.k.a. COVID-19) pandemic will have on Match's operating and financial performance in 2020. Moody's no longer expects Match will deliver quarterly sequential revenue growth in Q2 2020, or in the second half of 2020, given the evolving situation and numerous uncertainties related to the social considerations and economic impact from COVID-19 on the company's operations and financial leverage. The negative outlook also considers governance risks, specifically the likelihood that pro forma leverage at transaction close in Q2 2020 will be higher at roughly 5.6x (Moody's adjusted) compared to Moody's original estimate of 5x, and deleveraging to under 4x could take longer than 18 months after the spin-off from IAC (i.e., by year end 2021). The magnitude of the impact will depend on the depth and duration of the pandemic, the impact that government restrictions to curb the virus will have on consumer behavior, the duration of lockdowns in geographies that Match operates as well as the timeline for reopening bars, restaurants and other social gathering venues, which are important in the dating world.

Given the economic recession this year and the prospect of extended business closures and high rates of unemployment, an erosion of consumer confidence will lead to a reduction in discretionary consumption. While roughly 97% of Match's revenue is recurring subscription (typically ranging from 1 month to 12 months) or re-occurring à la carte microtransactions, Moody's expects subscription revenue to experience declines, slowing growth and increased volatility in the months ahead. The Tinder brand accounts for nearly 60% of Match's revenue and tends to attract the under 30 audience. Moody's expects regions with rising and high levels of young adult unemployment will negatively impact Tinder's new subscription sign-ups, renewals and enhanced feature offerings. ARPU is also likely to decline as users shift to lower priced subscriptions and less à la carte purchases. Moody's recognizes that differences in a user's age, gender and geographic location (hotspot vs. non-hotspot) as well as the rolling effects of the virus will drive the degree of decline and recovery given the company's broad geographic presence. The impact to the company's financial performance will mirror the timing of the outbreak, economic shutdown and eventual reopening in each region. Europe and the US will mostly impact Match's performance in Q2 2020 and potentially in Q3 2020, offset by growth in Asia-Pacific as that region's economies reopen.

Despite these revenue pressures, as more people remain at home during the pandemic, Match's services facilitate connectivity and relationships. Moody's expects user activity, conversations and engagement to continue to increase, especially among younger customers. This is primarily due to implementation of stay-at-home measures and closure of social gathering places for singles to meet, prompting them to adjust their behavior and dating methods. In the current environment, users have shifted to virtual dating via phone or video. To meet this demand, Match has quickly adapted its product offering to deploy one-to-one video chat capabilities on many of its platforms and accelerated the rollout of one-to-many live streaming video on Plenty of Fish, allowing users to connect with, and form, virtual communities around live video. Tinder will launch one-to-one live video in late Q2 2020. The company has also launched several new features and services such as the free Passport app on Tinder that allows users to change their geographic location and connect with members in regions that are more impacted by the pandemic, Match's launch of a coaching hotline, Hinge's ""Dating from Home"" prompts, and video-on-demand coaching and podcasts on Meetic. Moody's views these business model changes as credit positive.

Moody's estimates up to 66% of Match's operating expenses are variable enabling the company to quickly reduce operating costs in the short-run as a result of natural expense reductions that scale with revenue increases. The key variable cost elements are marketing spend and cost of revenue, which include mostly in-app purchase fees and credit card transaction fees. Moody's expects Match to reduce certain marketing costs and delay other marketing expenses to offset sequential revenue declines, as well as shift spend to more efficient channels. For instance, television viewership has increased but advertising rates have declined making this medium more effective in the current environment, while subway ridership and radio listenership are down making these out-of-home channels less effective. Since only a fraction of Match's H2 2020 ad spend is committed, it can easily make these adjustments. While Match will be judicious with other costs such as deferring non-critical hiring, the company will continue spending in areas where there are opportunities to increase engagement. As such, Moody's projects adjusted EBITDA margins (as calculated by Moody's) could temporarily migrate to the low end of the 30%-35% range over the coming quarters.

Match's Ba2 CFR is forward-looking and based on the capital structure at closing, which Moody's expects to occur in Q2 2020. The Ba2 rating reflects the company's historically high growth profile, albeit expected to slow this year, that will continue to benefit from long-term secular adoption of online dating and social networking apps to find romantic partners, friends and business associates. The credit profile considers Match's scale and leading market position as the number one online dating provider derived from its portfolio of more than 45 brands including Tinder, the highest grossing dating app globally. The company's dating apps have benefited from high user engagement with approximately 9.9 million average subscribers globally, creating a strong ""network effect"". Since Q1 2017, Match has added approximately 4 million average subscribers at an 18.8% CAGR. The rating is supported by a business model in which nearly all of the revenue is recurring subscription or reoccurring micro-transactions. The company also benefits from good geographic diversification with roughly 53% of Match's LTM 3/31/20 direct revenue derived from overseas markets and 47% from North America. Match has successfully leveraged its dating apps into geographies with higher growth potential by localizing and tailoring the content of its matchmaking apps to a country's cultural norms and preferences. Further support is provided by Match's disciplined investment and acquisition strategy, consistent profitability, strong operating cash flow generation and ability to de-lever from both EBITDA growth and ample free cash flow generation to repay debt.

The Ba2 rating embeds Match's strong projected debt protection measures for the rating category and track record of deleveraging to its target leverage of under 3x net debt to EBITDA (as-reported) via strong EBITDA growth. At transaction close in Q2 2020, Moody's estimates pro forma financial leverage at roughly 5.6x total debt to EBITDA (as calculated by Moody's) with free cash flow to adjusted debt of approximately 15% (excluding the $850 million one-time distribution). With the change in ownership upon close, Moody's anticipates a lower risk of outsized dividend payments, which should improve free cash flow conversion compared to prior years. Moody's expects adjusted EBITDA margins (as calculated by Moody's) in the 30%-35% area, supported by revenue growth in the 5%-8% range in 2020. The company has publicly committed to returning net leverage to under its 3x target (as-reported) within 18 months after the spin-off transaction closes (i.e., by year end 2021). However, given that Moody's projects a global economic recession this year with the G-20 economies contracting 4%, this will result in lower-than-expected EBITDA and a slower pace of deleveraging. As the virus threat is contained and economic growth gradually returns, Moody's projects the G-20 economies will expand 4.8% in 2021, with Match de-levering to the 4x-4.5x area (as calculated by Moody's) by year end 2021 mainly via EBITDA growth, barring sizable debt-financed M&A.

The Ba2 rating is constrained by Match's narrow business focus in a highly competitive industry with revenue concentration in the Tinder brand. Given minimal entry barriers, Match faces significant competition from a multitude of smaller players, such as Meet Group and MagicLab, which owns the number two mobile dating app, Bumble, and was recently acquired by The Blackstone Group; as well as larger players like Facebook, which launched its Facebook Dating mobile app in the US in September 2019.

Despite Match's strong growth trends in the past, there may be periods when it could experience weaker-than-expected revenue growth due to economic shocks, heightened competition, lower ARPU, reduced user traffic or higher customer churn, which weighs on the rating. Additionally, margins could experience pressure as Match invests in new geographies, product development, customer acquisition, marketing and data analytics to retain and attract subscribers to its dating apps. The online dating market is also susceptible to sudden changes in consumer engagement and rapidly evolving technology that could lead to declines in user activity and impact payer conversion and monetization. Moody's expects Match to continue to invest in technology, including machine learning and data science, as well as new product features to sustain high user engagement.

Over the next 12-15 months, Moody's expects Match to maintain very good liquidity (SGL-1 Speculative Grade Liquidity) supported by the company's ""asset-lite"" operating model that facilitates meaningful free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion in the 80%-90% range (excluding the $850 million one-time distribution) and robust cash balances (cash levels totaled nearly $900 million at 30 April 2020). Moody's projects free cash flow over the next twelve months in the range of $550-$600 million (excluding the one-time distribution). Match's external liquidity is supported by the recently upsized $750 million undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF), which provides ample alternate liquidity for growth opportunities and M&A. Moody's expects Match to use cash-on-hand to pay the $3 per share consideration, or approximately $850 million in aggregate, to Match's shareholders and IAC when the separation closes.

The RCF requires Match to maintain a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of less than or equal to 5.0x net debt to EBITDA (as defined in the bank credit agreement) whenever the facility is drawn. Upon separation, the calculation will exclude the exchangeable notes from the calculation since these obligations will reside at finco entities, however Moody's includes them in our adjusted gross debt calculations. Moody's estimates the company was in compliance with an approximate 50% cushion at 31 March 2020. While Moody's does not expect Match to draw under the facility over the coming 12-15 months (except for opportunistic M&A), we will closely monitor the covenant headroom, which could decrease as a result of EBITDA shortfalls or reduced cash balances. If the covenant cushion tightens over the coming quarters, Moody's expects the company will seek to obtain waivers from its banks.

Moody's Loss Given Default model excludes the exchangeable notes given their equity-like feature and potential redemption via stock in the future. Moody's also assumed minimal borrowings under the revolver and applied a -1 notch override on the credit facilities' ratings given the potential for a higher mix of secured debt in the future to support acquisitions or refinancing activity.

ESG CONSIDERATIONS

The rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices, and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The online dating sector has been one of the sectors affected by the shock given its sensitivity to consumer demand and sentiment. More specifically, the weaknesses in Match's credit profile, including its exposure to US, European and Asian economies, have left it vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment in these unprecedented operating conditions and Match remains vulnerable to the outbreak's continuing spread. Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Today's action reflects the impact on Match of the breadth and severity of the shock, and the broad deterioration in credit quality it has triggered.

A social impact that Moody's considers in Match's credit profile is the increasing usage of online dating and social networking platforms that help users find potential matches for dating, friendship and networking, which will continue to benefit Match and support solid revenue and EBITDA growth fundamentals over the next several years. Given that Match is entrusted with sensitive user data, Moody's notes that potential data privacy breaches could prompt some consumers to avoid using the company's dating apps thereby increasing social risk. Offsetting this risk is the company's continuing focus and increasing investment and training in its information security, privacy and user safety programs across all of its dating apps.

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

The rating outlook could be revised to stable if financial leverage declines to the 3.5x area (Moody's adjusted) and free cash flow to debt improves to the 15% range (Moody's adjusted, excluding the one-time distribution) coupled with revenue growth in the 12%-15% range.

A ratings upgrade is unlikely over the near-term, especially if the coronavirus outbreak and economic recession continue to impact users' willingness to purchase subscriptions and à la carte services from Match's dating apps. Over time, an upgrade could occur if Match exhibits revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion leading to consistent retained cash flow to net debt of at least 23% (Moody's adjusted) and leverage sustained near 3x total debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted). Ratings could be downgraded if a decline in revenue or higher operating expenses led to EBITDA margin contraction or total debt to EBITDA sustained above 4x (Moody's adjusted) 18 months after the spin-off transaction closes. There would be downward pressure on ratings if EBITDA were to weaken resulting in retained cash flow to net debt sustained below 15% (Moody's adjusted).

The principal methodology used in these ratings was Business and Consumer Service Industry published in October 2016 and available at https://www.moodys.com/research/Business-and-Consumer-Service-Industry--PBC_1037985.

Decent-to-upbeat earnings reports from Twitter TWTR, Snap SNAP, Spotify SPOT, Alphabet GOOGL and Facebook FB have boosted the space.

In the past month, SOCL has added 19.6% versus the S&P 500’s 14.2% gain. Notably, social distancing triggered by the coronavirus outbreak has benefited social media communication in the past month (read: Buy 5 Solid Tech ETFs At Least 10% Away From 52-Week High).

Inside Q1 Earnings

Twitter– In late-April,Twitterreported first-quarter 2020 non-GAAP earnings of 11 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10%. However, the figure decreased 70.3% year over year. Revenues grew 2.6% year over year to $807.6 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.5%.

Average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) were 166 million in the reported quarter compared with 134 million in the year-ago quarter and 152 million in the previous quarter. Lists, which make it easier for people to create and share timelines about the things that matter to them, improved engagement.

Facebook– After the closing bell on Apr 29, Facebook came up with mixed first-quarter 2020 results wherein it beat estimates on revenues but missed on earnings. Shares of Facebook rose more than 10% in aftermarket hours on elevated volumes (read: Facebook Soars Post Q1 Earnings: ETFs in Focus).

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.71, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 but up from the year-ago earnings of 85 cents. Revenues increased 18% year over year to $17.74 billion and edged past the estimated $17.29 billion. Notably, advertising revenues spiked 17% year over year to $17.4 billion.

The pandemic has led to a surge in online communication among Facebook members and live-stream gaming. FaceTime and video group calling have skyrocketed 1,000% in the past month. Daily and monthly active users grew 11% and 10% year over year, respectively, to 1.73 billion and 2.60 billion.

The company estimates that about 2.99 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger each month, and about 2.36 billion people use at least one of the Family of services every day on average.

Snap– The company reported first-quarter 2020 loss of 8 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.3% but narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 10 cents. Revenues surged 44% from the year-ago quarter to $462.5 million, beating the consensus mark by 9.1%. The revenue figure was within the guided range of $450-$470 million.

Average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 20.2% year over year. Snap witnessed more than 30% increase in communication among friends in the last week of March from the level seen in the last week of January with a more than 50% jump in some of the geographies that were hit hard by coronavirus. Shares benefited massively post earnings.

Alphabet– Google-parent Alphabet reported mixed first-quarter 2020 results on Apr 28, with earnings missing and revenues topping estimates. Earnings per share came in at $9.87, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.97 and declining 35.7% sequentially and 17.1% year over year.

Net revenues, excluding total traffic acquisition cost or TAC (TAC is the portion of revenues shared with Google’s partners, and amount paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website), came in at $33.7 billion, down 11.5% sequentially but up 14.3% year over year (read: Google ETFs Gain Despite Mixed Earnings Amid Coronavirus Crisis).

Spotify – In late-April, the company reported a quarterly loss of 22 cents per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 42 cents. This compares to a loss of 90 cents per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. It posted revenues of $2.04 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.72 billion.

Market Impact

Investors should note that Facebook, Twitter, Snap, Alphabet and Spotify have solid exposure in the social media ETF SOCL. Below we provide some details of the fund.

SOCL in Focus

This fund is a pure play in the global social media space. Facebook takes the second spot with about 10.27% exposure while Twitter accounts for 6.79% of the portfolio. Snap takes about 7.48% of the fund while Spotify and Alphabet occupy about 5.58% and 4.78% of SOCL, respectively. The fund has about $115.9 million in assets and charges 65 bps in fees (see all technology ETFs here)."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-amazon-share-buybacks-160125232.html,AAPL,2020-05-12T16:01:25+00:00,"Many corporations have sought government bailouts since the Covid-19 pandemic put the economy into reverse. In the cases of some companies, this prompted a backlash from critics, as these companies had recently spent millions or billions buying back their own (often overvalued) stock.

Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) captured this mood during Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting of shareholders on May 2. Responding to a question about stock repurchases, he said it had become ""very politically correct"" to speak out against them. Buffett defended buybacks in general, saying they were a legitimate way to distribute cash to shareholders.





In fact, Buffett reported that Berkshire had bought back some of its own shares in the first quarter of this year. He explained that share buybacks are a good practice when stocks are selling for less than their intrinsic value and the company has an ample store of cash on hand.

Some of the firms that should not have been buying back their stocks were the airlines. According to AlphaSense, a market intelligence company, Delta (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV) all repurchased shares in March.

Among large-cap, publicly-traded corporations, 99 companies bought back shares in March. The biggest among them were three tech companies: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft MSFT). Combined, these companies bought back enough of their own shares to make up more than 44% of all buybacks for the month.

However, one big tech company did not buy back shares - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has not bought back any of its own shares since 2012, even though the board authorized up to $5 billion worth of repurchases in 2016. The company has also never issued dividends.

In this article, we will take a look at potential reasons why Amazon.com has not repurchased shares while Apple has repurchased a ton.

The chart below shows the amount of cash and cash equivalents each of the two companies had on hand at the end of their most recent quarters:

GuruFocus Apple Amazon cash holdings More

As we can see, Amazon's cash flow has been relatively stable, while Apple's spiked recently. There are many potential ways to use that extra cash, including increasing capital expenditures, making acquisitions (CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple buys another company every two to three weeks), increase the dividend (which was 82 cents in the most recent quarter for an annual yield of just over 1%) and buying back shares.

Buying shares not only returns cash to shareholders, it also reduces the share count, increasing the earnings per share and driving up the share price. If there are not enough attractive acquisition or capex opportunities to consider, I believe this is typically the best way to return cash to shareholders.

Amazon, on the other hand, has taken the position that it never wants to mature. As CEO Jeff Bezos once put it, ""Day 1 is where we always want to be and Day 2 is where we never want to be."" Day 1 refers to growth and ever-increasing customer loyalty, while Day 2 refers to a mature phase when companies get comfortable and exchange high growth for returning more capital to shareholders.

As it keeps expanding its online marketplace and develops ancillary projects like iCloud, Amazon sees many opportunities to use its cash profitably. For nearly 25 years now, Amazon has delivered no dividends and few buybacks; it just keeps reinvesting the funds it generates. Long-term investors have profited massively, assuming they bought and held:

However, buying stocks and holding them for a long time -- and letting the magic of compounding do its thing -- is a time tested way to grow your wealth over time. Not all stocks are created equal, though, and picking the right stocks to add to your portfolio is critical to the success of this strategy.

With that in mind, here are two top stocks that you can buy and hold for a long time: NeoGenomics (NASDAQ:NEO) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

A cancer diagnostic company poised for growth

NeoGenomics runs a network of oncology-testing laboratories. The company offers genetic-testing oncology services to hospitals, pathologists, and oncologists, which help detect cancer earlier, thus significantly improving the patients' chances of survival. NeoGenomics also helps drugmakers through the clinical trial process. One of the healthcare company's offerings is helping pharmaceutical companies design proper studies to test their investigational drugs. NeoGenomics has easily outperformed the broader market over the past three years.

However, the company is currently facing headwinds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the company's first-quarter earnings conference call, NeoGenomics CEO, Douglas M. VanOort, said the following:

In April, clinical test volume declined slightly more and was down between 25% and 30% year-over-year, although it has appeared to stabilize on a week-over-week basis. The volume decline is understandable. In many regions of the country, oncology practices reduced their hours of operation and postponed or canceled patient appointments. Similarly, many hospitals reduced surgeries as they devoted resources to COVID-19 preparations and urgent needs.

VanOort believes these headwinds are temporary, and once the ongoing public health crisis ends, the company's business should get back on track. And once it does, investors who buy shares of NeoGenomics now will likely be glad they did. With an aging population -- and an increase in cancer incidence -- the oncology testing industry is set to continue growing. According to NeoGenomic, this market will grow at a rate of 6% to 8% annually.

As the leading oncology-testing company on the market -- which offers a breadth of test offerings that is second none -- NeoGenomics is well-positioned to profit from these trends. By buying shares of NeoGenomics and holding onto them for a while, investors can profit from these trends too.

Facebook remains the king of social media

Facebook's business has also been impacted by the ongoing crisis. The social media giant experienced a ""steep decrease in ad revenue in March,"" according to the company's CFO, David Wehner. However, Facebook's ad revenue seems to have recovered: ""We have seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April,"" said Wehner.

Also, Facebook's user base got a boost as a result of people being forced to stay at home. During the month of March, the company had 1.73 billion in daily active users, an 11% year over year increase, and Facebook had 2.6 billion monthly active users by the end of March, a 10% year over year increase.

And while the company does expect the increased engagement to decline once social distancing measures are pulled back, no other social media company boasts a network nearly as large as that of Facebook. Unless Facebook loses a large percentage of its users -- which seems unlikely -- the company will continue attracting advertisers on its platform.

Further, Facebook has many other assets at its disposal, including Instagram, which is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. Facebook launched Instagram Checkout last year, which allows Instagram users to purchase items directly from the app.

This move likely helped increase advertising on Instagram, as retailers increasingly looked to reach customers on the platform -- and vice-versa -- because of the convenience Instagram Checkout offered. Instagram brought in about $20 billion in ad revenue last year, according to some estimates.

Thanks to its dominance in the social media space, Facebook will remain a juggernaut for a long time. Investors looking for stocks to park in their portfolios should take a serious look at this tech giant."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-billionaire-ken-fisher-034418537.html,FB,2020-05-09T03:44:18+00:00,"Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of the 800+ fund managers actively tracked by Insider Monkey. A few months ago we asked the question whether Ken Fisher is a ""legendary investor or a marketing genius"". One thing is certain that Ken Fisher isn't an investor who tries to time the market. As the stocks fell all over the world during the first quarter, Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio also fell from $99 billion to $80 billion. We assume that most of this decline was due to the losses in stock prices rather than investor redemptions.

Wall Street analysts and investors don't respect Ken Fisher much. We have never heard of Ken Fisher's stock pitches move stocks the way Bill Ackman or David Tepper moves the markets. Nevertheless Ken Fisher has been able to deliver decent returns to grow his fund's AUM to nearly $100 billion. That's nothing to sneeze at.

[caption id=""attachment_26357"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""359""] Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management[/caption]

FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT More

In this article we are going to take a look at Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picks. Ken Fisher's all 10 stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index so far in 2020. During the first quarter Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks delivered an average loss of only 6%, vs. a loss of nearly 20% for the S&P 500 Index. That return was even better than the average return of top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of 6.9% during the first quarter. As you can guess top hedge fund stock picks is a very fertile area to look for good stocks to beat the market.

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years.

Keeping this in mind, let's now take a look at Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picks at the end of March.

The 10th largest position in billionaire Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Ken Fisher had $1.5 billion invested in this former technology giant. Intel Corporation isn't one of the top stocks in most hedge funds' portfolios. Hedge funds were actually selling their INTC positions heading into the first quarter. Intel shares performed better than most stocks during Q1 and are currently in the black for the year.

The ninth largest position in Fisher's portfolio was Tencent Holdings. Fisher had more than $1.5 billion invested in this Chinese tech giant. Tencent is a $500 billion company. It is interesting that Ken Fisher picked Tencent as one of its top 10 holdings and shunned a larger position in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Fisher had only $650 million invested in Facebook even though Facebook Inc.'s market cap is more than $600 billion. This tells us that Ken Fisher isn't a closet index fund manager. He actively allocated a smaller weight to Facebook Inc. Legendary investor Bill Miller doesn't think Facebook Inc is a good stock to be invested in after its 2020 gains. In the following video you can watch why Bill Miller thinks it doesn’t make sense today to invest in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and 6 other recession stocks that performed well so far this year.

The eighth biggest position in Ken Fisher's portfolio at the end of March was salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), valued at $1.57 billion. salesforce.com inc is in our shopping list too. CRM has been a hedge fund favorite for a long time but it really never got too cheap for us to recommend it to our subscribers. CRM shares returned more than 8% this year.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-recession-will-only-ignite-more-cordcutting-and-streaming-roku-exec-184517223.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T18:45:17+00:00,"The streaming content movement is gaining more ground, and at a faster clip.

Investors opted to take profits on red-hot Roku (ROKU) shares in the wake of first quarter-earnings on Friday amid concerns about weak advertising spending on the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. But aside from that, the shift to streaming content players such as Roku from linear programming that comes with a monthly giant cable bill remains strong.

In fact, with most everyone quarantined at home finding new ways to consume content, and many newly unemployed looking to cut costs, the transition to streaming perhaps got pulled up a few years in the matter of three months.

BRAZIL - 2019/09/11: In this photo illustration the Roku Streaming Player logo is seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) More

“Given the health and the economic crisis, at Roku we feel fortunate that we’re more relevant than ever before both to consumers for staying at home and content providers and advertisers,” Roku CFO Steve Louden said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Louden says Roku saw a “surge” in new accounts in April right along with a boost in streaming hours.

“The cord-cutting movement was accelerated prior to the recent impact of COVID. But the impact of people spending more time at home, and as they’re more mindful of budgets while looking at cable bills, could be substantial [drivers],” Louden added.

All of that was evident in Roku’s first quarter. Roku added 2.9 incremental new active accounts in the quarter, taking its total to 39.8 million. Streaming hours surged by 1.6 billion hours to a record 13.2 billion hours. Average revenue per user rose 28% from the prior year.

For now though, the market is taking its cue from Roku’s mixed guidance for the year.

Shares fell 7% on Friday as Roku warned of a substantial number of ad cancellations due primarily to the COVID-19 economic downturn. The company declined to provide detailed guidance, but it did note that it expects to produce an adjusted operating profit loss for the year.

“We assume COVID is an overhang on ad results for all of 2020 before improving in 2021 when we estimate the U.S. economy will begin to normalize,” wrote Pivotal Research entertainment analyst Jeff Wlodarczak in a note to clients.

So what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist? Microsoft (MSFT), Axon Enterprise (AAXN), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Insulet (PODD) and Pool (POOL), are looking stronger as the stock market continues to bounce back from the severe coronavirus correction.

While the long bull market was finally vanquished by the coronavirus crisis, things are again looking up. The stock market is once again in a confirmed uptrend. The rally has been strengthening, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq clearing key resistance levels and more top stocks breaking out.

A key to this is the improving news on Covid-19, both in the U.S. and around the world. Many states are now looking at how they are going to come out of lockdown and get their economies firing again. However, stress in the oil markets has added to uncertainty.

So why are these five names above the rest to buy or watch? Before turning to that question it is important to consider how one goes about choosing a stock in the first place. Superior fundamentals and technical action, and buying at the right time, are all part of a shrewd investing formula.

Several of the stocks named are featured on IBD's prestigious Leaderboard list of top stocks.

Best Stocks To Buy: The Crucial Ingredients

Remember, there are thousands of stocks trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq. But you want to find the very best stocks right now to generate massive gains.

The CAN SLIM system offers clear guidelines on what you should be looking for. Invest in stocks with current quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%. Look for companies that have new, game-changing products and services. Also consider not-yet-profitable companies, often recent IPOs, that are generating tremendous revenue growth.

IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System has a proven track record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Outdoing this industry benchmark is key to generating exceptional returns over the long term.

In addition, keep an eye on supply and demand for the stock itself, focus on leading stocks in top industry groups and aim for stocks with strong institutional support.

Once you have found a stock that fits the criteria, it is then time to turn to stock charts to plot a good entry point. You should wait for a stock to form a base, and then buy once it reaches a buy point, ideally in heavy volume. In many cases, a stock reaches a proper buy point when it breaks above the original high on the left side of the base. More information on what a base is, and how charts can be used to win big on the stock market, can be found here.

Don't Forget The 'M' When Buying Stocks

Never forget that the ""M"" in CAN SLIM stands for market. Most stocks, even the very best, will tend to follow the market direction. Invest when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend and move to cash when the stock market goes into a correction.

The current stock market rally became a confirmed uptrend after the S&P 500 staged a somewhat lackluster follow-through day on April 2. The Nasdaq's April 6 follow-through day was more convincing, while breakouts have been flourishing.

The best market gains often come in the first several weeks after a correction or bear market ends, so investors should be looking for stocks with good fundamental and technical performance, ones capable of staging successful breakouts. More quality stocks are also breaking out now. On a technical basis, look for stocks with rising relative strength lines.

Nevertheless, things can quickly change, so investors should keep a close eye on the market trend page here.

Best Stocks To Buy Or Watch

Now let's look at Microsoft stock, Axon Enterprise stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill stock, Insulet stock and Pool stock in more detail. An important consideration is that these stocks all boast impressive relative strength.

Check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens more of the best stocks to buy or watch.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock rose 5.8% in the week ended May 9 to 184.68. MSFT stock is now extended from an original 175.10 buy point on a double-bottom base. But it's still in buy range from a 180.10 handle.

In the latter half of April, Microsoft stock rose in a rolling, uneven fashion, echoing the action of the stock market rally. Even leading stocks will tend to follow the market. And Microsoft is a leader. The relative strength line for Microsoft stock is just off highs, and climbed solidly through the market crash and in the current stock market rally.

The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.

Microsoft stock has been outperforming the S&P 500 index for years. So it's no surprise that MSFT stock is a member of the prestigious IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Stocks on this list stabilize your portfolio but quietly deliver stellar long-term gains. To qualify as a Long-Term Leader, a stock has to have stable earnings, stable price outperformance and high-quality institutional sponsorship. These stocks can be bought on pullbacks or on breakouts.

Microsoft earnings growth has been strong, fueled by cloud computing and other cloud-based services that are in high demand during work-at-home coronavirus shutdowns. On April 29, the Microsoft earnings report for fiscal Q3 showed a 23% EPS gain while revenue rose 15%, the best top-line growth in six quarters.

Microsoft's Commercial Cloud business saw revenue jump 30% year over year to $13.3 billion in its fiscal third quarter. Its Azure cloud-computing services surged 62%. The Microsoft Teams video calling, chat and collaboration suite keeps workers connected.

Analysts see Microsoft earnings rising 20% in fiscal 2020 and 9% in 2021.

Microsoft stock is one of only a handful of U.S.-listed companies with trillion-dollar market caps. Indeed, Microsoft stock is once again worth more than Apple, for now. In this case big is beautiful as Microsoft stock has a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99.

Axon Enterprise Stock

Axon stock bolted above an 80.26 buy point after the Taser maker posted stunning results late Thursday. MarketSmith analysis shows AAXN stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base and is now slightly extended from the 5% chase zone.

There were some technical hints that the recent IBD Stock Of The Day was getting set to make a big move. Axon stock reclaimed its 50-day and 200-day lines on Thursday, and closed above both key technical benchmarks.

Axon Enterprise stock has a stellar Composite Rating of 95. The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that it boasts extremely strong stock market performance.

But even this is outstripped by Axon's earnings excellence, which has netted the stock an EPS Rating of 98. Over the past three quarters, the stun gun maker's earnings growth has been electric, swelling by an average of 176% over the past three quarters.

Axon earnings per share grew 90% to 40 cents, which was more than 100% above Wall Street estimates for 18 cents. Revenue rose 27% to $147.2 million.

Revenue from sales of law-enforcement cameras and cloud-based software licenses grew more than 40%. Taser revenue, which now accounts for about half of total revenue, grew 16%. Axon withdrew its guidance of $100 million to $105 million in adjusted EBITDA on revenue of $615 million to $625 million, though not because of current trends.

The hit to municipal budgets and their impact on procurement by law-enforcement agencies ""could materially alter our pipeline,"" Axon said.

Chipotle Stock

Chipotle stock has swept into the buy zone after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on May 8. The ideal entry point is 909.98, but it is still actionable. Its strong recent performance has seen it take a place on the IBD Leaderboard.

Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Wingstop (WING), have been faring well. But those two chains were primarily delivery or takeout operations before the coronavirus bans, while Chipotle had relied heavily on dine-in customers.

Chipotle stock is currently flying high above both its 50 and 200-day lines. The reason it is so high above both key technical benchmarks is the stock has managed to increase in value by almost 11% so far this year.

Its outperformance is further reflected in its relative strength line. While it dipped slightly amid the coronavirus crash, it has roared back strongly and is now at highs last seen in 2015. This was before a string of food-safety incidents badly damaged the stock.

But there is still room for yet more improvement, as the stock's Composite Rating is sitting at a strong but not ideal 93. The Stock Checkup tool shows earnings have grown by an average of 50% over the past three years. This is double the level sought by the CAN SLIM cognoscenti.

Chipotle stock gapped up in massive volume while still within its deep base after the chain reported upbeat earnings on April 22.

Chipotle earnings per share fell 9%, even as sales grew 7.8%, to $1.4 billion. But the key point for investors was the fact that the fresh Mexican food chain's digital sales soared 81% and accounted for more than 26% of its business as the company has emphasized home delivery and pickup amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""Investing in digital over the last several years has allowed us to quickly pivot our business with Q1 digital sales reaching our highest ever quarterly level of $372 million,"" CEO Brian Niccol said in a pres release.

""Our strong brand, business model and balance sheet give us the confidence to not only weather this downturn but continue to judiciously invest in key areas so that when we come out the other side, we will emerge even stronger.""

Niccol also cited ""cooking fatigue"" as people get tired of cooking at home all the time during coronavirus shutdowns.

Insulet Stock

The diabetes treatment firm staged a bullish upside reversal on May 8 after reporting a wider-than-expected loss but giving decent guidance. Insulet stock closed the day at 217.63, still in range from a 209.94 cup-with-handle buy point. PODD stock had broken out a day earlier.

The relative strength line is at all-time highs, and it has generally been outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 13 months. Insulet stock hit a low point for 2019 at 80.43 last April. Since then, shares have been steadily rising.

Insulet stock currently has a Composite Rating of 81. Stock Checkup shows earnings are its Achilles' heel, which is reflected in its EPS Rating of just 8. Nevertheless, its stock market performance has been stellar, which is reflected in its Relative Strength Rating of 96.

Insulet recently reported a net loss of 3 cents per share for Q1. That reversed from a 7-cent gain in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research called for a loss of 2 cents. Sales jumped 24% to $198 million, however. That easily beat forecasts for $189 million.

Insulet, which makes insulin pumps for diabetes treatment, trimmed its 2020 outlook following a mixed first quarter. It now expects 15% revenue growth in 2020, which would come out to roughly $848.7 million in full-year sales. That narrowly tops Wall Street's estimate for $839 million in full-year revenue. Nevertheless, the fact that it is in this line of business is expected to help it weather the coronavirus recession better than most.

The viral outbreak weighs on some medical technology outlets as doctor appointments and elective procedures are delayed. But Insulet's business benefits from recurring revenue, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a report to clients.

Marcus doesn't expect Insulet to be immune from the effects of the pandemic. But he does expect the company to be better insulated than a major portion of medical technology companies.

""While Insulet will no doubt experience Covid-19 headwinds along with the rest of medtech in the coming months, the recurring revenue nature of the business and the life-or-death nature of diabetes treatment makes the company relatively well positioned over the coming months,"" he said.

Insulet is in a hot group at the moment, though Dexcom (DXCM), which makes continuous glucose monitoring systems, is arguably the real leader. The latter stock is currently on Leaderboard. Tandem Diabetes (TNDM), an Insulet rival, is racing up the right side of a base, just below a buy point.

Pool Stock

The world's largest distributor of wholesale swimming pools is certainly making a splash. It has muscled its way on the IBD Long-Term Leaders watchlist due to its excellent performance. In addition, investor's could soon dive into the stock, as it is closing in on a buy point.

Pool stock has formed a cup-with-handle base and is close to reaching its 229.98 buy point. It is well clear of its 50-day line.

The RS line for Pool stock is near record highs. Looking on a monthly chart, Pool stock has a long stretch of outperforming the S&P 500.

In a nutshell, an IBD Long-Term Leader is a stock with stable earnings, stable price performance, and high-quality institutional sponsorship that will outperform the market. These are stocks that you buy and, within reason, hold. All stocks that qualify also must boast quality institutional ownership. Here Pool stock scores highly, as it boasts an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A, which reflects strong buying from institutions.

Pool stock currently holds a top-notch Composite Rating of 96. The Stock Checkup tool is also showing encouraging signs for the stock. It currently boasts average earnings growth of 22% over the past three years. While it is not quite up to CAN SLIM requirements, it is good for a Long-Term Leader stock.

Pool is showing leadership, and currently sits atop the Retail-Leisure Products industry group. Winmark (WINA) and MarineMax (HZO) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks.

Too much volatility can be bad for your stomach, and even worse for your pocketbook during inevitable shakeouts. This is why Long-Term Leaders are important — they stabilize your portfolio but quietly deliver stellar long-term gains.

Recently Removed Stocks

Apple (AAPL), Adobe (ADBE) and PayPal (PYPL) have been given the ax after becoming extended past their buy zones. AMD (AMD) was trimmed; it has been moving sideways but is still worth watching.

Facebook (FB) - Get Report, which in March asked its workers who can work from home to do so, will now allow most of them to keep doing so through year-end.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg will announce that policy Thursday, a company spokeswoman told CNBC. Facebook is still deciding which staffers will be asked to come back to their offices.

The company is scheduled to begin opening most of its offices July 6, according to CNBC.

Zuckerberg said last month that the company has a “responsibility to allow people who don’t have this flexibility to access shared public resources first.” The company provided its employees $1,000 to finance working at home and child-care needs.

Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi provided a mixed prognosis for Facebook after its first-quarter earnings report last week.

“Facebook posted first quarter revenue and EBIT ahead of our projections and the FactSet consensus,” he wrote in a commentary.

But, “the firm … expects a decline in margins, as it will continue to invest in new products. We still expect a decline in total revenue for the full year, as the economic downturn will likely continue to reduce overall ad spending, including online.”

And, “unlike Alphabet, Facebook has not diversified its revenue and cannot reduce the impact of Covid-19 on its top line,” Mogharabi said. “However, we were pleased with growth in user count and engagement, which could strengthen the firm’s network effect moat source.”

Facebook shares recently traded at $210.96, up 1.19%. The stock is almost unchanged from three months ago."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebooks-oversight-board-members-nobel-154941161.html,FB,2020-05-07T15:49:41+00:00,"Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) on Wednesday announced the first 20 members of its content oversight board, nearly 18 months after CEO Mark Zuckerbag first shared a blueprint of the plan.

Facebook Boasts Diverse Board

Former Prime Minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Stanford Law School Professor Michael McConnell, Columbia Law School Professor Jamal Greene and Dean of the Universidad de los Andes Faculty of Law Catalina Botero-Marino will serve as the co-chairs of the Oversight Board, Facebook said.

Other members include Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize awardee Tawakkol Karman, Kenyan human rights activist Maina Kiai, Pakistani digital rights activist Nighat Dad and the Indonesian publication Jakarta Post's editor Endy Bayuni.

Facebook said diversity was an important criteria in its selection, and said that its members have lived in over 27 countries and speak over 29 languages.

The social media company noted that the oversight board has five members from the United States and Canada, four members from Europe, three members from Asia-Pacific & Oceania and two each from Latin America & the Carribean, Middle East & North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central & South Asia.

Board Can Override Zuckerberg's Decisions

Facebook said it selected the four co-chairs with external help, who in turn helped elect the rest of the 16 members.

Once all of the 40 members of the board are selected, the Zuckerbeg-led company will stop interfering in the selection process and the existing members will decide on the selection of future members, according to Facebook.

The oversight board, which was created by Facebook in the wake of the criticism related to hate speech and harassment on its platform, will have the ultimate authority over what content stays and what is removed from the platform.

""We expect them to make some decisions that we, at Facebook, will not always agree with — but that's the point: they are truly autonomous in their exercise of independent judgment,"" Facebook said in a statement.

""We also expect that the board's membership itself will face criticism. But its long-term success depends on it having members who bring different perspectives and expertise to bear.""

FB Price Action

Facebook shares were trading 0.82% higher at $210.17 at the time of publication Thursday. The shares traded 0.22% lower at $208.01 in the after-hours session.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-youtube-race-squash-viral-012628641.html,FB,2020-05-09T01:26:28+00:00,"Earlier this week, a Southern California filmmaker posted his newest production on Facebook and YouTube and let the social media platforms do what they've been built for: make his video go viral.

Within days, the 26-minute video had spread like wildfire, racking up millions of views and attracting legions of new fans. The video, called ""Plandemic,"" looks like a serious documentary, with well-shot interviews intercut with news footage and ominous music. But it propagates coronavirus conspiracy theories, which could encourage viewers to ignore public health recommendations or attempt ineffective or dangerous treatments for the viral infection.

By Thursday, the social media companies where the video proliferated pledged to stop the video's spread. They're now struggling to stop new copies from emerging. As of the time of this article's publication, links to or versions of the video were still available on both Facebook and YouTube.

Medical misinformation has proliferated on the major social media platforms for years, especially around the topic of vaccine safety. The platforms have pledged to more strongly enforce misinformation policies, but the task has proven difficult for companies whose services are designed to allow users to reach large audiences with little oversight. But the coronavirus crisis has been especially fertile ground for conspiracy theorizing, inspiring viral videos spinning tales of international intrigue and profiteering cabals since nearly its inception.

The ""Plandemic"" video centers on interviews with a researcher named Judy Milkovits, whose false claims include the allegation that wealthy people are intentionally spreading the novel coronavirus to increase vaccination rates in the population at large and that wearing a mask can actually worsen viral symptoms.

In a statement, a Facebook representative said that the company was removing the video from Facebook and Instagram and rejecting ads that include the video, as part of their policy to take down COVID-19 related misinformation that could lead to imminent harm. The company wrote in a blog post in mid-April that it had directed over 2 billion people to fact-checking information from the World Health Organization to try and combat misinformation about the pandemic.

""Suggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm,"" a Facebook representative said when asked about the ""Plandemic"" video response, ""so we've removed the video.""

YouTube has posted notices on the uploads of the video that read: ""This video has been removed for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines."" The video platform Vimeo has also said that it is working to remove the video, and Twitter has been blocking hashtags and search related to the video.

Mikki Willis, the filmmaker behind the video, is listed as founder and chief executive on the website of Elevate, an Ojai-based production company. Willis has a large following on Facebook. In recent weeks, he asked his followers to vote on a name for his newest video (other candidates included ""The Oath"" and ""The Invisible Enemy""), and published long posts claiming to connect the WHO with conspiracy theories surrounding the Council on Foreign Relations and the recent death of Jeffrey Epstein.

The video's virality was boosted by online anti-vaccine conspiracy theory activists, according to coverage in the MIT Technology Review. When YouTube began removing copies of the video on Thursday, supporters took to Twitter with their outrage, making the video's title a trending topic, fueling further attention and media coverage."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indian-court-seeks-govt-reply-111838800.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T11:18:38+00:00,"By Sankalp Phartiyal

NEW DELHI, May 8 (Reuters) - A court asked the Indian government on Friday to respond to a challenge against its order for compulsory use of a contact tracing app by public and private sector employees returning to work amid the world's biggest coronavirus lockdown.

India launched the Aarogya Setu, or ""Health Bridge"", app last month. Downloaded to the phones of 94 million Indians, it makes use of Bluetooth and GPS to alert users who may have encountered people who later test positive for the virus.

But mandatory use of the app forces a user to ""give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy,"" a member of the opposition Congress party said in a petition to the high court in the southern state of Kerala.

""Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system,"" said the petition, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

The court has fixed a hearing on May 12.

India's technology ministry did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters to seek comment.

The app was initially available only on smartphones running on Google's Android and Apple's iPhones, leaving out nearly 400 million people who use only basic feature phones.

Officials at the tech ministry and a lawyer who framed the app's privacy policy have said it needs to be on at least 200 million phones to be effective among a population of 1.3 billion.

Now, seeking to widen its use, New Delhi plans to launch within days a version for mobile carrier Reliance Jio's $9 internet-enabled phones, Reuters has reported.

The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better target health efforts, the tech ministry said in late April, adding that information would be used ""only for administering necessary medical interventions"".

New Delhi has said the app will not infringe privacy as data is collected anonymously.

As India scales back in low-risk zones the shutdown that began on March 25, it has vowed to hold company heads responsible for ensuring that all returning workers use the app.

Digital rights activists have criticised the order as a violation of the principle of consent. Critics, including a French hacker, have raised privacy concerns and want the app's source code made public, but the government says it is safe.

App use should be mandatory only in containment zones, Delhi-based think tank the Dialogue told the government, calling for independent data auditing to preserve checks and balances.

Many nations are using similar apps but some, such as Australia and Colombia, are turning to technology from Apple and Alphabet's Google amid citizens' privacy concerns and glitchy state-backed systems.

India has reported 37,916 virus infections and 1,886 deaths.

Louis DeJoy of Greensboro, a close ally of President Donald Trump, was the unanimous pick of the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors, which made the announcement.

He’s expected to begin the job on June 15, succeeding Megan Brennan,who became the first woman to serve as postmaster general in 2015. She announced in October that she planned to retire.

From the MarketWatch archives (May 2018): Trump pressured U.S. postmaster general to jack up shipping rates for Amazon

DeJoy, a retired logistics company CEO, had been heavily involved in fundraising for the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, scheduled to begin in August.

“Having worked closely with the Postal Service for many years, I have a great appreciation for this institution and the dedicated workers who faithfully execute its mission,” DeJoy said in a news release late Wednesday. The board said it conducted a nationwide search that began with reviewing records of over 200 candidates.

Trump mentioned DeJoy by name at recent North Carolina campaign rallies. DeJoy is “a friend of mine who has been with us from the beginning,” Trump said at a event in Fayetteville in September.

DeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos, is Trump’s nominee to become the next U.S. ambassador to Canada. Wos, a retired physician, was the state Health and Human Services secretary for then-Gov. Pat McCrory.

DeJoy’s selection comes as the Postal Service, with over 600,000 workers, has had many years of net losses caused in part by declining first-class mail volume. It’s now hurting more with revenue losses due to COVID-19.

The USPS received a $10 billion loan under the government’s pandemic rescue package, but Democratic lawmakers are seeking more funds for the agency.

Trump, however, has threatened to veto anything that helps the post office. The president also has complained about the rates charged by the postal service to Amazon AMZN, -2.16% and other companies to deliver their packages. Trump has threatened blocking the $10 billion loan unless those rates are raised dramatically.

Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:

These Tech Giants Set Wall Street's Northward Trajectory

After a disappointing March, Wall Street had a dream run in April, registering its best monthly performance in more than five decades. The rally was broad-based as 10 out of the 11 broad S&P 500 sectors advanced strongly. Only the utility sector received a minor setback. Among the top performers, it was the technology sector that alone set the rally on track.

Technology Sector Fuels Rally

In April, the S&P 500 gained 12.7%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR, the most important component of the broad market index, rallied 13.7%. Moreover, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index advanced 15.5% last month. The Nasdaq Composite witnessed the best April in its history and registered the best monthly performance since 2000.

Meanwhile, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — declined 3.7%, 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, in the last day of April and the first day of May. However, on May 4, all three major stock indexes ended in the green buoyed by the strong performance of large-cap tech stocks. In fact, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best intraday comeback since Mar 19 and 25, respectively.

Technology Sector on Strong Footing

In financial literature, technology is known as the high-growth sector. During severe market downturn, growth stocks likely to suffer the most. Recently, the situation was aggravated as almost all U.S. tech behemoths are highly dependent on China for their business.

China plays the role of both a low-cost supplier as well as the largest market of high-tech products. With the coronavirus outbreak starting in China and then spreading across the world, the global supply chain was completely destroyed.

The technology sector was feared wide to suffer major setbacks owing to the coronavirus-induced economic disaster. In contrast, its strong growth came as a pleasant surprise to market participants.

The world is witnessing rapid technological improvements owing to unprecedented growth in high-speed mobile Internet traffic, particularly with respect to wireless data and video. These developments have transformed this sector into an ever-evolving, inventive and keenly contested space.

Growing deployment of next-generation super-fast 5G technology and massive application of IoT have created significant demand for technically sophisticated products. Moreover, large tech companies are rapidly shifting to the digital media platform offering online TV streaming services, resulting in innovative product differentiation.

5 Tech Behemoths Flying High

Five technology behemoths have popped in the past month and set Wall Street on a rally. These stocks have strong growth potential and either a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Facebook Inc. continues to witness significant traction in online and mobile advertising spending. The company intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.

Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow for Facebook after introducing its ad platform to worldwide advertisers. Messenger and WhatsApp are the other prized possessions. Ephemerality and end-to-end encryption are also driving the popularity of WhatsApp.

The Zacks Rank #3 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.1% and 32.3% for the current and next year, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and next-year earnings has improved by 0.1% and 0.8%, respectively, over the past 7 days. The stock has rallied 33.1% in the past month.

Apple Inc.'s Services and Wearables businesses are expected to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond. Although Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as its new cash cow. Robust App Store sales coupled with solid adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Music are expected to help the company double its Services revenues by 2020.

For many, dividends provide a steady and, hopefully, rising income stream, no matter what's going on with the stock market.

Or so many think.

Of course, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies in travel and leisure, airlines, and oil and gas are cutting their payouts. Even the mighty Disney (NYSE:DIS) is suspending its next biannual dividend. It could do more.

However, the danger I'm talking about isn't related to the coronavirus. Once the virus subsides, dividend investors should also be aware of the big risk that applies to all dividend stocks, regardless of industry, debt levels, or payout ratio.

Don't get blindsided

Once a company gets to a certain size and scale, it usually starts paying a dividend. This typically happens after a company has achieved some success. As the good times roll on and the company grows, companies usually feel pressure to raise those dividends every year. If they don't, dissatisfaction among investors can grow. Management doesn't like disappointing investors, and many companies have declared their dividends sacrosanct. This is especially true once a business becomes a Dividend Aristocrat, a company that's raised its dividend annually for at least 25 straight years. Once you're anointed an Aristocrat, it's hard to be demoted to something less than!

However, there may come a point at which the dividend, which is a cash outflow to the business, becomes a burden rather than a bonus. While any one dividend payment is unlikely to change a company's trajectory, a high and growing dividend may cause a business to under-invest in its business over time.

In the worst case, under-investment can leave a seemingly ""safe"" company vulnerable to disruption. Disruption usually comes from young, hungry growth companies without dividend burdens that aim to reshape an industry in a new and better way.

Disruptive companies tend reinvest all profits -- and perhaps even more -- into the business. And if successful, disruptive growth companies can be such massive long-term winners that their returns more than make up for the lack of dividend, sometimes by staggering amounts.

Don't believe me? Here are several examples.

Netflix disrupts big media

There was once a time in which big media stocks were among the best, most-coveted companies in the world. These cable and broadcast companies receive affiliate revenues from distributors and advertising revenues from large companies looking to reach their massive audiences. That led to big-time growth in the 1990s and early 2000s, with high profits and dividends aplenty.

Then came Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disrupted the entire media landscape by introducing over-the-top, commercial-free internet streaming for a low monthly fee. While many of the legacy media companies were growing fat on their profits, and often paying dividends, Netflix instead reinvested all of its revenue into producing more and more content. In fact, not only did Netflix spend all its revenue, but it also spent more than that, taking on incremental debt to fund original content, while also paying hefty licensing fees to partners.

Legacy media were hesitant to disrupt their own highly profitable businesses, which allowed Netflix to gain a substantial head start. Now, it may be too late for others to catch up.

The result? Most legacy media companies have seen big declines in their share prices, while others have merged with large cable or telecom companies, basically ""selling out"" before things got worse. Meanwhile, Netflix's stock has gone on to trounce the competition.

T-Mobile disrupts big telecom

The same story has played out in the telecom space as well. For many years, the ""big two"" telecom networks of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) enjoyed an effective duopoly, with the nation's two leading mobile networks. Their high and rising dividends also made them very popular safe-haven picks for retirees and other dividend investors.

Enter T-Mobile USA (NASDAQ:TMUS), the U.S. telecom majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY). After a merger with smaller carrier MetroPCS in 2013, T-Mobile underwent a substantial rebranding campaign as the ""Un-Carrier"" under CEO John Legere. T-Mobile spent big on the customer experience, offering affordable plans and doing away with usual industry pain points, such as annual contracts, overage charges, and hidden taxes and fees.

Meanwhile, T-Mobile continued to invest heavily in its networks, never paying a dividend, bringing its quality closer and closer to par with the big boys. Now that T-Mobile was finally able to merge with fourth-place carrier Sprint, the combined company actually has a chance at leap-frogging the two leaders in the race to a superior 5G network.

In its just-reported quarter, T-Mobile continued to rack up market share gains, with 777,000 postpaid net additions and 7% branded postpaid revenue growth on top of 5% revenue growth. While not exactly a highflier, that represented about 70% of the entire industry growth during the quarter, and the 25th quarter in a row that T-Mobile has led the industry in net addition growth.

While you would have enjoyed the dividends from AT&T and Verizon over the past five years, T-Mobile's disruption would have led to even bigger overall gains.

Amazon disrupts... everyone

Finally, perhaps the most disruptive stock in the world is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has gone on to disrupt not one but two large and profitable industries. The first is traditional brick-and-mortar retail, especially mall-based retail, which used to enjoy fat profit margins, big dividends, and buybacks.

However, Amazon led the e-commerce industry in building out a first-class online experience, including a huge selection of inventory and fast shipping times. This was all turbocharged by Amazon's Prime offering, which offered free two-day shipping on most goods for an annual subscription fee, which ""locked"" customers into its ecosystem.

Of course, offering low prices and high customer satisfaction cost a lot of money, and Amazon has never paid a dividend. In fact, in most years of its corporate life, Amazon either broke even or lost money. However, that didn't stop the stock from going on to greater and greater heights as it racked up more and more revenue and market share:

But Amazon wasn't content to disrupt only retail. Perhaps more consequential was Amazon's disruption of the enterprise technology space, specifically by inventing the concept of cloud computing. While high-touch consulting and on-premises technology management made traditional enterprise IT services a very profitable business, the public cloud has allowed enterprises greater flexibly, affordability, and access to the latest technology on a per-use basis. That's taken market share away from many big IT companies that used to ""rule"" enterprise IT and pay out large dividends, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).

For those who say disruptive businesses don't ever make a profit, the Amazon Web Services cloud computing division just reported 33% growth, with operating margins above 30% last quarter, proving that even disruptors can be profitable, given enough time.

Even Berkshire Hathaway is looking to disrupt utilities

Longtime fans of Warren Buffett know that his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) has never paid dividends. While the primary reason is to give Buffett and his partners as much capital as possible to make market-beating investments, the lack of a dividend also allows Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries to invest as much as they can or want without capital constraints.

One case in point is Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a subsidiary created when Berkshire bought MidAmerican Energy in 1999. Under Berkshire, MidAmerican has grown into an industry leader, often with superior service and lower prices than its competitors. In fact, in last year's annual letter to shareholders, Buffett informed shareholders that, thanks to huge past investments in wind energy, Berkshire's Iowa utility beats its main competitor's electricity rates by a stunning 70%!

At this year's annual meeting, Buffett and likely successor Greg Abel outlined another $100 billion of investment opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway Energy in the coming years, because of the need for updates energy infrastructure in the U.S. -- to which Buffett added (emphasis mine):

[W]e're better positioned than anybody in the energy business just because we don't have dividend requirements. We retained 28 billion of earnings over 20 years. You can't do it if you run a normal public company. And we've got a huge appetite, and the country needs it; the world needs it.

Don't ignore dividend stocks, but make sure they're protected

As these examples show, disruptive competitors without dividend burdens can make extraordinary gains for shareholders at the expense of incumbent dividend payers. In retrospect, you would have been better off buying any of these disruptors, and then perhaps selling a few shares every year instead of depending on regular dividend payouts. So that's another method to consider in lieu of a dividend strategy.

Of course, this doesn't mean you should ignore dividends altogether. After all, Buffett himself also owns a lot of dividend stocks. However, if you own a stock for its dividend, you need to ask if there are potential disruptive threats to the business, and if the business is making all the investments it needs to grow and adapt.

The main point is, dividends and dividend growth can't overcome superior business strategies and better customer experiences. So, dividend investors, make sure the companies in your portfolio provide these, whether they pay a dividend or not!"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-reopen-stores-germany-may-152539777.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T20:08:35+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will start reopening U.S. retail stores next week, beginning in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama and Alaska.

The company said Friday it will require “additional safety procedures, including temperature checks, social distancing and face coverings to ensure customers and employees continue to stay healthy.”

Apple said its primary focus in the stores will be providing technical support to customers forced to work and attend school from home amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The iPhone maker’s Boise, Idaho, location will become the first U.S. reopening on Monday, while some of the five stores in the other three states will let in people later in the week, Apple said.

“Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will,” the company said in a statement. “As local guidance varies around the U.S. there may be slight modifications to our procedures.”

Apple said it will allow customers to schedule product pickups at the reopened stores. The company has more than 270 stores in the U.S., and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook previously told Bloomberg News that they would re-open on a city-by-city basis beginning in mid-May.

The company said its “new social distance protocol allows for a limited number of visitors in the store at one time so there may be a delay for walk-in customers” and that it recommends customers buy products online.

Apple shares gained 2.1% on the news, closing at $310.13 in New York.

The company said earlier Friday that it will reopen its 15 retail stores across Germany on May 11 with limited hours and health precautions. The moves expand on Apple’s other recently opened locations in South Korea, Austria and Australia.

Apple’s stores in all other regions outside of China, including Japan, U.K. and Canada, remain closed. The company has more than 500 retail stores worldwide.

Retail chief Deirdre O’Brien said last month that she expected “many more” locations to re-open during May.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vista-stake-caps-8-billion-102416944.html,FB,2020-05-08T10:24:16+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is a man on a mission: to dominate India’s consumer Internet market -- from online retail to digital payments.

He just sealed three deals in as many weeks to raise a combined $8 billion, including from Facebook Inc. Asia’s richest man isn’t done yet, as he races to transform the legacy oil-and-petrochemicals empire his late father built into a technology-driven, e-commerce force.

In the latest announcement Friday from his Reliance Industries Ltd., Vista Equity Partners agreed to pay $1.5 billion for a 2.3% stake in Jio Platforms, the conglomerate’s digital unit. Earlier this week, Menlo Park, California-based Silver Lake Partners said it would invest $753 million in the business, hot on the heels of Facebook’s decision in April to plow $5.7 billion for a 10% stake in Jio.

The flurry of transactions show the tycoon’s ambitions to pivot Reliance Industries into an Indian technology titan are going into hyperdrive. With investments from the likes of the social-networking giant and the two private-equity firms, Ambani, 63, is not only getting Silicon Valley’s backing for his plans, but is also raising funds to honor a pledge he made to investors in August -- to wipe out net debt at his group.

“Mukesh Ambani’s transformation plans for Reliance Industries tell us we can expect significant upside in the years to come,” said Chakri Lokapriya, managing director at TCG Asset Management. “He clearly understands that a technology company is valued much higher than the underlying commodity business of Reliance.”

The agreements also showcase the deal-making chops of the Mumbai-based company, when most of the world is in a lockdown to help contain the spread of Covid-19. As travel curbs stymied progress on the talks, trusted lieutenants of Ambani and Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg turned to video conferences and phone calls to wrap up the deal, people familiar with the matter said last month.

Jio Platforms’ turn as an an investor magnet is built on the potential of India’s digital market, both enterprise and consumer. Every business rooted in ancient practices and technologies is ripe for disruption -- be it the centuries-old kirana or mom-and-pop stores, its traditional education system or hospitals.

Impenetrable Market

On top of that, India is the only large open Internet market where foreign technology giants such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc and Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc. can fight for market share and dominance. Neighboring China, another huge market, is impenetrable for foreign technology companies.

Investors are enthused by the potential of Jio Platforms with its aspiration to upend not just online retail but also content streaming, digital payments, education and healthcare. It has even jumped into video conferencing via its JioMeet app.

“Reliance is the giant that can pull all this off,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and chief executive officer at technology and digital advisory, Greyhound Research. “It can marry its offline assets with its online properties for better monetization and multiple revenue streams. That excites investors who are seeing it as a hybrid opportunity.”

Cashless System

Facebook and India’s largest corporation both serve around 400 million users in the country, and they’ve made it clear the first order of business is establishing a cashless system to anchor forays into Internet commerce and mobile services. That alliance inserts a powerful new competitor into an arena already contested by Google, Walmart, Amazon and SoftBank Group Corp.-backed local outfit Paytm.

But none of them have the reach of Facebook’s WhatsApp, the nation’s most popular communications platform.

With its investment, Vista would become Jio Platforms’ largest investor after the parent and Facebook, Reliance said in a statement Friday.

“We are excited to leverage the professional expertise and multi-level support that Vista has been offering to its investments globally for the benefit of Jio,” Ambani said in the statement. Shares of Reliance Industries rallied 3.6% on Friday to cap the seventh week of gains, the longest winning streak since 2016.

Similar Deal

After the three rounds of stake sale, Jio Platforms -- which combines the might of the company’s wireless platform with some apps and ecosystems -- is now valued at about $65 billion. That’s about half the market value of parent Reliance.

May 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said Friday it will reopen a handful of stores in four U.S. states starting next week, in the first resumption of physical retail operations since the iPhone maker shuttered all U.S. stores in mid-March.

The company said it will open ""some"" stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina. Apple has two stores in both South Carolina and Alabama but did not say which would open. Its Boise, Idaho location will open Monday, with others to follow later in the week.

Apple executives have said they are examining local health data at the county and city level in each community where the company has physical stores to determine when to reopen. Apple has locations in several U.S. states, such as Texas and Georgia, where state rules would in theory allow it to reopen stores, but it has not yet announced plans to do so.

""Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will,"" Apple said in a statement.

In the four states where Apple stores will reopen, new procedures will be in place similar to those in countries such as South Korea, Australia and Austria, where stores have already reopened.

Customers and employees will be required to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the stores, and Apple will provide a mask if customers do not have their own. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of customers in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.

""With many working and learning from home, our primary focus will be providing service and support,"" Apple said. ""We recommend, where possible, customers buy online for contactless delivery or in-store pick-up.""

Apple will still have demonstration devices for customers to handle in the store, but staff will clean them often, and hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed in stores.

Apple earlier on Friday said it would reopen stores in Germany. The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores began reopening outside the Greater China region in mid-April with its store in South Korea.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-amazon-share-buybacks-160125232.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T16:01:25+00:00,"Many corporations have sought government bailouts since the Covid-19 pandemic put the economy into reverse. In the cases of some companies, this prompted a backlash from critics, as these companies had recently spent millions or billions buying back their own (often overvalued) stock.

Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) captured this mood during Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting of shareholders on May 2. Responding to a question about stock repurchases, he said it had become ""very politically correct"" to speak out against them. Buffett defended buybacks in general, saying they were a legitimate way to distribute cash to shareholders.





In fact, Buffett reported that Berkshire had bought back some of its own shares in the first quarter of this year. He explained that share buybacks are a good practice when stocks are selling for less than their intrinsic value and the company has an ample store of cash on hand.

Some of the firms that should not have been buying back their stocks were the airlines. According to AlphaSense, a market intelligence company, Delta (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV) all repurchased shares in March.

Among large-cap, publicly-traded corporations, 99 companies bought back shares in March. The biggest among them were three tech companies: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft MSFT). Combined, these companies bought back enough of their own shares to make up more than 44% of all buybacks for the month.

However, one big tech company did not buy back shares - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has not bought back any of its own shares since 2012, even though the board authorized up to $5 billion worth of repurchases in 2016. The company has also never issued dividends.

In this article, we will take a look at potential reasons why Amazon.com has not repurchased shares while Apple has repurchased a ton.

The chart below shows the amount of cash and cash equivalents each of the two companies had on hand at the end of their most recent quarters:

GuruFocus Apple Amazon cash holdings More

As we can see, Amazon's cash flow has been relatively stable, while Apple's spiked recently. There are many potential ways to use that extra cash, including increasing capital expenditures, making acquisitions (CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple buys another company every two to three weeks), increase the dividend (which was 82 cents in the most recent quarter for an annual yield of just over 1%) and buying back shares.

Buying shares not only returns cash to shareholders, it also reduces the share count, increasing the earnings per share and driving up the share price. If there are not enough attractive acquisition or capex opportunities to consider, I believe this is typically the best way to return cash to shareholders.

Amazon, on the other hand, has taken the position that it never wants to mature. As CEO Jeff Bezos once put it, ""Day 1 is where we always want to be and Day 2 is where we never want to be."" Day 1 refers to growth and ever-increasing customer loyalty, while Day 2 refers to a mature phase when companies get comfortable and exchange high growth for returning more capital to shareholders.

As it keeps expanding its online marketplace and develops ancillary projects like iCloud, Amazon sees many opportunities to use its cash profitably. For nearly 25 years now, Amazon has delivered no dividends and few buybacks; it just keeps reinvesting the funds it generates. Long-term investors have profited massively, assuming they bought and held:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-says-delivery-speed-returning-014814866.html,AMZN,2020-05-13T01:48:14+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says the one- and two-day delivery times that shoppers have come to expect should gradually return in coming weeks as the online retailer catches up from a demand surge tied to the coronavirus outbreak.

The company on Sunday lifted restrictions on the amount of inventory its suppliers can send to Amazon warehouses and is shortening delivery times -- which had stretched for weeks for some products since the outbreak began -- back to days.

Amazon spends months preparing for the surge in consumer demand that usually comes during the holiday season. The Covid-19 outbreak that closed many retail brick-and-mortar stores and sent millions of shoppers online created a month’s worth of Black Friday spending without warning. Once Amazon fell behind, it took several weeks and hiring 175,000 people to get back on track.

“We removed quantity limits on products our suppliers can send to our fulfillment centers,” Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said in an email. “We continue to adhere to extensive health and safety measures to protect our associates as they pick, pack and ship products to customers, and are improving delivery speeds across our store.”

Even with the delays, Amazon saw a major spike in sales tied to the coronavirus outbreak because shoppers had so few choices. Amazon, big box stores, supermarkets and pharmacies were among the few businesses deemed essential and allowed to remain open. But the delays were starting to tarnish Amazon’s reputation with its customers and its merchants who supply more than half the goods sold on the site.

Quick delivery is central to Amazon’s customer promise, helping it attract more than 100 million people who pay monthly or yearly dues for Prime memberships. Prime members spend more on the site than non-Prime members, making it critical for Amazon to get its delivery times back to normal especially as retail stores begin reopening and shoppers have more options.

When Seattle-based Amazon was overwhelmed in April, many shoppers saw the long delivery times and shifted their purchases to pickup curbside options offered by Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., said Anthony Ferry, chief executive officer of PriceSpider, which tracks web traffic for more than 1,600 brands, including consumer staples made by Procter & Gamble Co. and Kraft Heinz Co.

“Loyal Amazon shoppers left the site when they saw long delivery times or items were out of stock,” he said. “Buy-online pickup-in store has become a much more enticing and desirable solution when people want something now.”

Amazon let employees worried about their safety take time off during the outbreak, which increased absenteeism and aggravated the delays. Some lawmakers, unions and workers have criticized Amazon for not doing enough to protect its warehouse workers and continuing deliveries through the pandemic. Company officials have said repeatedly they have taken multiple steps, including extensive cleaning at facilities, to keep its employees healthy.

Long delivery times were beginning to erode Amazon’s stellar brand reputation among consumers, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the New York research firm Marketplace Pulse that monitors the site. Shoppers left 800,000 negative reviews on Amazon’s shopping site in April, double the number in the same month a year ago, with much of the increase attributable to longer delivery times, he said.

“Amazon is known for great selection, low prices and fast shipping,” Kaziukenas said. “These all broke during the pandemic. Selection was not always there, prices were not lowest because Amazon sold out, and fast shipping was gone.”

Even Amazon’s merchants, many of whom rely on the company to store, pack and ship their products through the Fulfillment By Amazon logistics service, started doing things themselves to quicken the pace of deliveries.

Bellroy has been selling wallets, smartphone cases and laptop sleeves on Amazon for seven years and used Fulfillment By Amazon because quick delivery is popular with coveted Prime members. But by the end of March, delivery times for many of its products were as long as 30 days and sales plummeted. Amazon was prioritizing essential items. So Bellroy began packing and shipping many of its products itself, and now does the logistics for about 20% of its sales on Amazon, said Lina Calabria, co-founder and chief operating officer of the company.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/08/most-alarming-thing-about-disney-earnings-parks.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,NFLX,2020-05-08T00:00:00,"As was largely expected, the coronavirus pandemic took a toll on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) last quarter. Although the top line was up more than 20% thanks to a booming cable television business, the closure of its theme parks and hotels as well as movie theaters proved costly. Operating income fell nearly 40% year over year, from $3.8 billion to $2.4 billion. Again, though, nothing about that profit headwind was a surprise.

There was something of a curveball buried in the breakdown of Disney's differing business units, however, for the three-month stretch ending in March. While its streaming service Disney+ has become a fast-growing hit, this business is proving very expensive to run. The company's direct-to-consumer (and international) arm contributed $4.1 billion to the top line, but its operating loss more than doubled year over year.

It's not too soon to start asking where Walt Disney's breakeven point on streaming lies.

Crunching the numbers

Credit has to be given where it's due. Disney made a big splash in an on-demand world dominated by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Since launching Disney+ in November, the company has amassed at least 50 million paying customers for the service. Its ESPN+ launched in 2018 and still boasts only 7.9 million subscribers. Hulu has been around for years, but Disney reports it's got only 32.1 million customers, 28.8 million of whom watch only its on-demand content; the other 3.3 million also view its live TV programming.

Given the average monthly price paid per service, subscription fees alone are now driving about half of this unit's sales. The other half, more or less, comes from affiliate fees and advertising related to international television channels like Star and Disney's Twenty-First Century Fox property.

Whatever Disney is doing to power this business unit forward, however, it's costing a relative fortune. In the same quarter that this division collected $4.1 billion worth of revenue, the company also spent more than $3.7 billion on operating expenses and more than another $1.0 billion selling and simply managing the business. Net result? An $812 million operating loss that extends an ugly trend.

An inauspicious start

If this reflects the unit's current cost norms -- and it likely does, given the trend -- Walt Disney may want to think more critically about the plausible future balance between revenue and expenses. As it stands right now, there's little point in expanding the business.

Of course, where things stand right now isn't where they'll stand a year from now. These streaming services (Disney+ in particular) are still growing. In a business that's about scale, more paying customers should eventually offset those big cost increases. A movie or television program only has to be paid for once, but it can be sold over and over again to as many customers as are willing to pay for it.

But there's a flip side to that coin. A great deal of the content available through Disney+ has already aired on cable television or in movie theaters, and while the streaming arm ""pays"" the media and movie arms for access to content, one has to assume those prices reflect a friends-and-family sort of discount.

Hulu enjoys a similar situation. While it offers a few originals, much of its on-demand content comes from ABC and Fox, which Walt Disney also owns. The company's direct-to-consumer content costs should be relatively modest. So far they don't seem to be.

Buckle up

It's still the early innings of this game, to be fair. Last quarter was the first full quarter for which Disney+ was in operation, and it was an unusual one to say the least. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic is difficult to measure, and Walt Disney is still trying to build the aforementioned scale it needs to make Disney+ viable. That requires advertising. The media giant is also still likely closer to the beginning of its learning curve than the end in terms of cost-effectively managing the technology needed to digitally distribute this much video content.

It's also worth noting the Disney+ price point of $6.99 per month isn't etched in stone. Netflix made tempered price hikes, and Disney+ likely will too. That will offset more of the operating and administrative spending.

Nevertheless, this is a cause for concern, if only because the company seems intent on holding off on any price increase for as long as possible. Then-CEO Big Iger commented during the earnings call in February, ""We really are not focused right now on price at all. We believed all along that we would have an opportunity to address pricing as we added more content, particularly original content, and the price-value relationship went up to the consumer, but it's not a priority of ours right now because we're still very new at this.""

And as for content costs, prospective numbers are being tossed around and they're not small. Disney said last year that Disney+ would kick off with $1 billion worth of original content, but that figure would grow to around $2 billion per year by 2024. Licensed content costs for Disney+ were around $1.5 billion per year at launch, but Disney expected that spending to swell to around $2.5 billion by 2024 as well. For perspective, Netflix had planned to spend on the order of $15 billion on content this year to keep its 183 million subscribers satisfied.

And that's just Disney+. There are still operating and content costs related to streaming services Hulu and ESPN+.

It all puts a lot of pressure on Walt Disney's pricing power with Disney+, which has yet to be truly tested. Investors may want to brace for the fact that streaming is apt to be a profit drag for a while, even if it is worth it in the long run."

The three major domestic equity indices tore higher last week, even as new corporate earnings results and economic data reports revealed more evidence of the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

However, investors have already begun pricing in a rebound later this year, even as health officials warn of a second wave of infections, and rising numbers of economists estimate a sharp rebound is increasingly unlikely given the severity of the economic damage.

“What’s happening in the market now is there are two mantras working. One is don’t fight the [Federal Reserve], and the other is the market is always four months ahead of GDP,” Barry Bannister, Stifel’s head of institutional equity strategy, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.

“In a sense, it’s reflecting an inflection upward in GDP sometime later this summer, call it August,” Bannister said — which could reverse if the rebound fails to materialize, he added.

That, however, remains a distinct possibility in the face of dire economic data that’s projected to get even worse. Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor showed employers cut a record 20.5 million payrolls in April, erasing a decade worth of jobs gains within that month alone. The unemployment rate hit 14.7%, jumping in just two months from February’s 50-year low to an all-time high, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data back to 1948. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox News Sunday, “The reported numbers are probably going to get worse before they get better.”

But as some analysts noted, the dismal data could serve as impetus for lawmakers to unleash further stimulus to help support Main Street workers and businesses – giving investors hope that such relief measures would eventually offset the economic damage imposed by the pandemic.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note that his firm thinks “the key consequence of the jobs report—which, in truth, delivered no real surprises to markets—is that it will push Congress nearer to another substantial stimulus package.”

Other strategists agree that swift fiscal and monetary support have been a key component of stocks’ recent moves higher — especially given the speed and breadth with which these relief measures have come.

Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan, said in a note that policymakers “injecting liquidity in key financial markets and lowering cost of capital (e.g. interest rates cuts, credit spread compression via various lending facilities and direct payments), will put a floor under equities.”

The Nasdaq was up 1.7% for the year to date as of market close Friday, outperforming the S&P 500 and Dow, which were down 9.3% and 14.7%, respectively, over the same period.

Still, stocks’ rallies after the recent batch of historically weak economic data and downward revisions to corporate earnings outlooks for this year have led at least some strategists to declare the stock market overvalued.

Citing unnamed sources, the Nikkei Asian Review reports that around 30%, or 3 million to 4 million, of Apple's AirPods will be produced in Vietnam. Production of Apple's higher-end AirPods Pro will remain in China, however.

Apple began the shift in March, even as Vietnam was in a lockdown due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Nikkei reports. The tech giant has been leading the earbuds market for some time now, commanding 36.5% of the market as of the end of 2019.

For months, reports have swirled that Apple was looking to diversify its supply chain amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. Apple reportedly reconsidered that plan that when both sides reached a Phase One trade agreement late last year.

That was before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, however, creating huge supply chain issues in China. Production is back to normal, but the disruptions potentially could delay the launch of Apple's 5G iPhone. Apple's plans to roll out new AirPods in 2020 could also be impacted by the pandemic."

Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, told employees on Thursday to prepare to work remotely through October and possibly to the end of the year, according to people familiar with the decision. A spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of staff is expected to work from home until 2021.

Two weeks ago, Pichai wrote an email to his workforce that said some offices would open as soon as June. This week, employees were told returns would vary by division and location but that most Google staff would not return until at least the end of October, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly.

On Thursday, Facebook told employees that they can work remotely through 2020 if they like. The social media company doesn’t expect to open most offices until July 6 at the earliest.

The edicts from the internet giants come as states and corporations grapple with ways to reopen as the virus pandemic rages on. California, Google’s home state, is letting some businesses open in limited ways, including some manufacturing. Select executives, namely Tesla Inc.’s Musk, are outspoken advocates for opening up the economy, although most technology leaders are being more cautious.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was one of the first Silicon Valley companies to shut its offices in early March. In his April email, Pichai said any return would be “staggered” and “incremental.” The company employs more than 100,000 people and has tens of thousands of contract workers.

In March, Google said it would cover pay and sick leave for contract staff impacted by office closures, such as cafeteria workers, and planned to evaluate the decision “over the coming months.” A spokesperson did not comment on that policy.

Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 4.34 million. Covid-19 deaths are at least 292,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped 1.4 million, with deaths above 83,000. U.S. coronavirus cases in the past two days have hit their lowest levels in weeks. Coronavirus testing has increased substantially, with the share of positive tests falling. Much of the improvement in terms of new cases has come in the New York/New Jersey area.

Dr. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, cited concerns about reopening certain parts of the country. Los Angeles County extended its stay-at-home order by another three months. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials warned of business failures on a ""grand scale.""

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally pulled back, closing at session lows on some of those coronavirus shutdown headlines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.9% and the S&P 500 index 2.05%. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.1%, snapping a six-session win streak with an outside day, downside reversal.

Apple stock, a Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq component, retreated 1.1%, also breaking its six-day win streak. The relative strength line for Apple stock hit a record high.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) slid 2.6%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 2.35%. Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are big IGV holdings. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 2.75%, with Nvidia and AMD notable members

The coronavirus stock market rally arguably has been due for a pullback. But should it be a lot lower?

Stock Market Rally Disconnect From Economic Reality?

Many argue that there's a disconnect between the coronavirus stock market rally from the economic reality of a massive recession and joblessness. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and will shed millions more in May. Unemployment is expected to top 20% at a minimum. There are some positive signs while states and countries are starting to open up, but until there's a vaccine much of the economy will be in a lower gear or shut down entirely.

So is the coronavirus stock market rally divorced from reality? Let's take a closer look.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Winners

The big stock market rally winners during the coronavirus crisis aren't a surprise. Many are just outright coronavirus plays: Zoom Video (ZM), Moderna (MRNA), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Peloton Interactive (PTON), along with Netflix stock, Amazon stock and Shopify stock.

Meanwhile, AMD stock, Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock, Nvidia (NVDA), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and many others — especially software — are benefiting in various ways from the stay-at-home trend, helping people hold up or even thrive in the coronavirus crisis.

Further down, there are internet giants Facebook stock and Google stock as well as digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL). Facebook and Google are seeing strong demand from people stuck at home. PayPal is benefiting from people adopting digital payments. Facebook stock, Google stock and PayPal stock may do especially well in a world of continued social distancing but with a recovery in advertising and consumer spending.

Likewise, Apple stock and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) have broken out. Apple and Lululemon are upscale consumer discretionary companies. In the midst of a deep recession where people have been stuck at home, status-enhancing discretionary purchases would seem at risk. But, to be blunt, many people who buy Apple and Lululemon products haven't lost their well-paying jobs. If these consumers feel confident that the economy will improve, they're willing to spend today.

Also, some medicals are doing well, seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, such as Dexcom (DXCM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Finally, a few consumer products companies like Clorox (CLX) and General Mills (GIS) were plodding along before the coronavirus crisis but have seen demand spike for cleaning products, cereal and soup.

So there's a good argument for all of these stocks to be doing well. In other words, the leading stocks in the coronavirus market rally don't seem disconnected from their companies' reality.

Given the heft of Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Netflix stock, Amazon stock, Nvidia stock, AMD stock, Facebook stock, Google stock, PayPal stock, Shopify stock, ServiceNow stock, along with many other coronavirus market rally winners, it's easy to see why the Nasdaq composite is doing so well.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Losers

Meanwhile, plenty of ""real economy"" market sectors have been badly hit: travel, leisure, energy, manufacturing and many retailers and financials. Many of these sectors are shut down.

Most of these companies were struggling before the coronavirus with beaten-down stocks. The market cap on many of these stocks is fairly low. Macy's (M), the nation's largest department store chain, has a market cap of $1.55 billion. Contrast that to Microsoft stock, with a market cap of $1.38 trillion. So solid advances by megacap techs such as Microsoft, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock can offset much bigger losses by companies with lower valuations.

Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, with more ""real economy"" stocks than the Nasdaq, have made far less progress in the coronavirus stock market rally.

Keep in mind that the stock market is made up of major companies, with most ""small-cap stocks"" small relative to the giants, but still fairly substantial operations. The stock market is not a microcosm of the overall economy, with the millions of truly small businesses struggling to survive.

Yes, The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Is Surprising

All that being said, it is surprising to see the stock market rally so quickly toward highs, even setting aside the economy. The old saying is that markets fall on an elevator and rise on an escalator. But the current stock market rally has run up almost as fast as the market crash.

The fact that the U.S. economy is suffering a historic contraction amid a still active pandemic makes the pace of the stock market rally even more surprising.

Follow, Don't Fight The Stock Market

But you want to pay attention to what the stock market is doing right now. Don't try to impose your opinions on it. The stock market doesn't care what you or I think.

Perhaps the market will re-evaluate the economic and earnings outlook to the downside, via a grim economic report, big corporate warning or a spike in coronavirus cases.

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock market move sideways for several weeks or pull back, at least somewhat.

Then again, maybe the stock market rally will surge into new high ground and beyond.

No matter what happens, if you're following the coronavirus market rally via the major indexes and leading stocks, you'll be ready to move with the stock market trend. Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Top Stocks To Watch

Microsoft stock, AMD stock, ServiceNow stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is Apple stock, which is modestly extended. Meanwhile, Facebook stock, AMD stock and Apple stock are on SwingTrader.

NFLX stock, FB stock, AMD stock and NOW stock are all IBD 50 members, along with several other stock market rally winners cited above.

Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

ServiceNow Stock

ServiceNow stock fell 4.7% to 365.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading. NOW stock is still above the 363.05 cup-base buy point. A pullback toward the buy point is normal, especially with race-from-the-bottom cup patterns.

The relative strength line for ServiceNow stock is still near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ServiceNow stock can be bought now, or perhaps at 388.60, just above Monday's all-time high.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock fell 2.3% to 182.51. MSFT stock is in range from a 180.10 handle on a double-bottom base. The RS line for Microsoft stock is at record highs.

Microsoft stock has the largest valuation of any U.S.-listed company. It just edges out Apple stock, which is at $1.35 trillion. Amazon stock follows at $1.18 trillion and Google stock at $939 billion.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock sank 2% to 431.82. NFLX stock is extended from an April breakout, but has been consolidating for a few weeks. It's not long enough for a proper base, but 449.62 could serve as an entry point for Netflix stock. A stock market rally pause or pullback could offer more time for NFLX stock to form a traditional consolidation.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock sank 2.2% to 2,356.95. Like Netflix stock, AMZN stock has been consolidating for a few weeks, though the e-commerce and cloud-computing services giant popped to a record 1,475 on April 30 just before earnings. Amazon stock fell on the earnings miss and weak guidance, but has remained in its recent range. A move above the old high would offer an entry point for Amazon stock.

AMD Stock

AMD stock sank 3.55%. The chipmaker is working on a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. AMD stock recently lagged some other data-center chipmakers, such as Nvidia stock and Inphi (IPHI), but may be perking up again. AMD earnings per share surged 300% and 200% in the last two quarters.

Facebook Stock

Facebook stock dipped 1.4% to 210.10. FB stock is steadily moving toward a V-shape consolidation with a 224.30 buy point. The relative strength line for Facebook stock has ramped up sharply in the last few weeks. Facebook stock once again on Tuesday was a ""Blue Dot"" stock, signifying stocks in bases with RS lines at new highs. They are identified on MarketSmith charts with a blue-shaded dot at the end of their RS lines.

A coronavirus stock market rally pause could offer a chance for Facebook stock to build a handle.

Google Stock

Google stock fell 2% to 1,375.18. A cup base with a 1,530.84 buy point has formed for GOOGL stock. Google stock, like FANG peer Facebook's stock, is a Blue Dot special today.

In a working life helping traditional businesses navigate the upheavals of new technology, he has also rethought his own path along the way.

For more than a decade, the 48-year-old senior digital executive, who lives in São Paulo, has worked with organisations adapting to digital disruption and innovation, first at Google and now with Brazilian media and entertainment group Rede Globo. All the while, developing the skills to put himself in others’ shoes, divine their business needs and communicate how he can help has been at the centre of his career.

During 12 years at Google, Maria’s core work was building relationships with publishers, including newspapers, broadcasters and retailers. “In 2011 in Brazil, the news industry was very averse to Google,” he recalls. “I could not have a conversation with a newspaper CEO — they wouldn’t even respond to my calls.”

The icy reception was understandable. At the time, digital was decimating the traditional news industry. Readers were finding their news online, advertisers were following them and the print revenue model was struggling.

Against this backdrop, the Brazilian was tasked with finding areas where the competitor could become a collaborator. He joined Google as a strategic partner manager and eventually rose to become director of global partnerships for Latin America and Brazil across broadcast, news and commerce.

“Google has the advertising sales role that competes with all the other groups for advertising budgets . . . and that is how it is going to work forever,” Maria acknowledges. “But I was in a group that was looking at the other side — which is, how can we help these partners develop themselves, be more efficient in the way they do their business and also generate revenue?”

He also worked with journalists, explaining how to mine Google data for investigative work; he taught publishers how technology could help them understand users’ behaviour; and he helped optimise mobile products. The global accumulation of such work grew into the Google News Initiative, which supports journalism in the form of a training centre and an innovation fund, for example.

After 12 years at Google, Maria was at a crossroads. If he stayed, the next step would be a move abroad, in a new role and culture. That did not fit with his personal plans, so he decided to take a career break, spend time with his family — he has three sons — and reflect on his next move.

CV 2004-2005 Product and services director, Oi Internet 2006-2007 Product manager, Brasil Telecom Internet 2007-2011 Strategic partner manager, Google 2011-2016 Head of strategic partnerships, Latin America, Google 2016-2017 Director of global partnerships, Latin America, Google 2017-2019 Director of global partnerships: broadcast, news and commerce, Google 2019-present Director of new business development, Rede Globo

Careers, he says, are a three-stage journey. At the beginning, professionals’ skills tend to be more technical. Then they may become people managers, giving up much of the practical work and developing skills in leading teams and building a vision. The third is the executive level, looking at companies strategically in the long term.

Maria was ready to transition to the third stage. So in 2018, while at Google, he enrolled for the counsellors development programme, a corporate governance course, at Fundação Dom Cabral business school in Brazil.

“It was right for that moment in my career,” he says. “It let me invest some time to understand the strategic role of boards better and how to then influence the management team of the organisation.”

People should be prepared to stay offline and connect to the people on the course and the course itself

The programme, which he completed at FDC’s Belo Horizonte campus, prepares future board members. Alongside teaching the principles of management and governance, it explores how to apply this — for example, participants prepare for and lead mock meetings of directors.

The return to formal learning was “amazing”, Maria says. His career break meant he was spared balancing family, work and study during the course, which was taught in two week-long blocks a few months apart. This allowed him to engage fully, he adds, something that those thinking about executive courses should be ready to do.

“People should be prepared to stay offline and connect to the people on the course and connect to the course itself,” he says. “It is expected that you participate a lot and there is real value in bringing your experience. It enriches the conversation and the practical exercises.”

This also means students should share any difficulties or areas for improvement with classmates. “Be present, be honest and be fearless,” Maria says. “The more you are open, the more people will be able to help you and you will be able to help [other] people.”

One of the benefits was building a strong network of like-minded peers, and Maria continues to help people stay in touch as a class ambassador.

The programme has helped in his role as director of new business development at Globo, which he started last June. “It’s not the specific technical things that I use,” he says, “It is much more of a mindset change on how to look at and approach things in the long run, looking at what is in the minds of executives and the board.”

There is real value in bringing your experience. It enriches the conversation and the exercises

Globo may be Maria’s biggest challenge yet. As part of its digital transformation, the company announced last year that it was bringing some of its businesses together in one group, including broadcast and cable television companies, its website and video on-demand service.

Alongside the internal change, Maria is working on building this new media technology business for advertisers. “The opportunity is how to integrate all these mediums,” he says, so that advertisers can communicate their messages seamlessly across all of Globo’s channels. For example, he adds: “Can we look at the journey when people move out of TV and go to an app to continue consuming the content?”

This approach and information would help advertisers understand what message works best where and when. It also benefits consumers, he says, in that adverts should feel less jarring if selected in such a way.

“We still serve interruption,” he says. “But we need to make interruption much better in a way that is connected to the content and to what is relevant to people.”

It was the scale of the challenge that persuaded Maria to take the role at Globo. When the chief executive presented his vision for the business, three elements clicked into place: the level of transformation; a realisation that Maria could use his training in digital and fast-moving environments; and finding something that he was good at and excited about.

“I said, ‘OK, three or five years later, if I look back and we were able to implement the level of transformation that the vision says, I’m going to be very proud of that.’ And that’s a legacy I’m going to leave. Talking about a media group, it’s actually a legacy that my kids are going to know about.”"
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/disney-dis-stock-streaming-earnings-preview?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO,NFLX,2020-05-05T15:05:00+00:00,"Disney has bounced from the lows but could go either way on its earnings. Let's map out some levels on the chart for the stock.

Walt Disney (DIS) - Get Report was rising almost 2% Tuesday ahead of the company’s earnings report after the close of trading.

Investors will be watching this one closely. Like Netflix (NFLX) - Get Report, Disney+ has already seen a large uptick in subscribers. In fact, the platform has already logged more than 50 million subs.

That will be the focus when the company reports earnings. That’s as the rest of its business - theme parks, studio and network revenue - have been severely impacted by the coronavirus.

So far, Disney stock has had a solid bounce from the lows. Earnings can be a volatile event and if investors are disappointed the rally over the past month has the potential to give way to a pullback.

Let’s take a closer look at the charts.

Trading Disney Stock

Weekly chart of Disney stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com

When Netflix reported earnings last month, the stock had recently hit new all-time highs. Despite a stellar quarter of subscriber growth though, the stock has pulled back.

While Disney stock is still well off its highs, the fear here is the same. That is, a sell-the-news reaction to its earnings. That said, the stock is at an interesting spot on the chart.

Shares are coiling directly beneath long-term uptrend support (blue line), as well as the 38.2% retracement for the 2020 range. At the same time, shares are forming a tightening trading range — a wedge — ahead of earnings.

It’s likely that the report will thrust Disney stock out of this formation. We just don’t know if it will be higher or lower.

If it’s higher, look for DIS stock to rally to the 200-week moving average, a mark that rejected it in April. Above that puts the 50% retracement in play near $113, as well as the multi-year breakout mark near $115.

Over $115 and bulls will be firmly in control of Disney shares. This is a big area to keep an eye on.

If the break is lower, I would like to see Disney hold the 23.6% retracement near $95, as well as the $92-ish area, which was significant amid the March pullback. Below puts $85 in play.

Keep these levels in mind once Disney opens for trading on Wednesday. Beyond that though, they're likely to play a role for days, weeks and possibly months from now."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-reports-spike-takedowns-hate-181056864.html,FB,2020-05-12T18:10:56+00:00,"By Katie Paul

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Tuesday reported a sharp increase in the number of posts it removed for promoting violence and hate speech across its apps, which it attributed to technology improvements for automatically identifying text and images.

The world's biggest social media company removed about 4.7 million posts connected to hate organizations on its flagship app in the first quarter, up from 1.6 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. It also deleted 9.6 million posts containing hate speech, compared with 5.7 million in the prior period.

That marks a six-fold increase in hateful content removals since the second half of 2017, the earliest period for which Facebook discloses data.

The company also said it put warning labels on about 50 million pieces of content related to COVID-19, after taking the unusually aggressive step of banning harmful misinformation about the new coronavirus at the start of the pandemic.

""We have a good sense that these warning labels work. Ninety-five percent of the time that someone sees content with a label, they don't click through to view that content,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters on a press call.

Facebook released the data as part of its fifth Community Standards Enforcement Report, which it introduced in 2018 along with more stringent decorum rules in response to a backlash over its lax approach to policing content on its platforms. These include Facebook's Messenger and WhatApp mobile apps.

It expanded the report last year to include information about how it enforces rules on photo-sharing app Instagram and said on Tuesday it would begin releasing the data on a quarterly basis.

In a blog post announcing the report, Facebook highlighted improvements to its ""proactive detection technology,"" which uses artificial intelligence to detect violating content as it is posted and remove it before other users can see it.

""We're now able to detect text embedded in images and videos in order to understand its full context, and we've built media matching technology to find content that's identical or near-identical to photos, videos, text and even audio that we've already removed,"" the statement said.

Improvements to that technology also enabled the proactive removal of more drug-related and sexually exploitative content, the company said.

With fewer moderators available during the pandemic, Facebook has relied more on automated tools to police content as conspiracy theories about the coronavirus have spread online.

On the call, Zuckerberg said contractors in some parts of the world were starting to return to their offices, but cautioned that the coronavirus adjustments were likely to have a heavier impact on the data in the second quarter.

Cindy Otis, a disinformation researcher and former CIA analyst, noted that coronavirus-related abuse likewise spiked in April, after the period covered in the report.

She urged Facebook to disclose how quickly it removes posts, a key indicator of the effectiveness of its systems, as it often appears to act only after content has gone viral and spread to other platforms.

""The pandemic has been the largest event in disinformation and misinformation history,"" she said, ""and that does not appear to show in their numbers they provide.""

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amgen (AMGN), BHP Group (BHP) and Altria Group (MO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Amgen shares have been standout performers lately, both relative to the broader market as well as relative the peer group. This reflects growing sales momentum, according the Zacks analyst, for Amgen’s drugs like Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla and biosimilars will drive sales even though competition for its legacy products is steadily increasing.

Amgen beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q1. However, it expects a significant impact from coronavirus-related business disruption in Q2, which it expects will ease in the second half of 2020. Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio, which can drive long-term growth.

Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline while regularly pursuing “external opportunities” such as the acquisition of Otezla and the stake in China's BeiGene. Amgen also expects several important clinical data readouts from its innovative pipeline in 2020. However, pricing and competitive pressure are concerns.

These are tough times for BHP and other miners, as you can see from the stock's recent underperformance. But the critical factor for operators like BHP at this stage is the abilit to survive and it remains well positioned on that front. The Zacks analyst believes that BHP Group’s strong cash flow and focus on lowering debt are likely to enhance its capability.

The company maintains capital and exploration expenditure guidance below $8 billion for fiscal 2020 and $8 billion for fiscal 2021. It currently has six major projects under development in petroleum, copper, iron ore and potash. Efforts to make operations more efficient on the back of smarter technology adoption across the entire value chain will drive growth.

However, slowdown in global growth and lower commodity prices due to the coronavirus outbreak is likely to impact results. The consensus estimate for earnings for the current fiscal has undergone negative revision lately. Nevertheless, even though metal prices remain subdued in the near term, it will eventually pick up on the back of the impending demand-supply imbalance.

Altria’s shares have lost -19.1% over the past three months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s fall of -17.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that the company has been battling weak cigarette volumes due to stern regulations and consumers’ rising health awareness.

Though reported domestic cigarette shipment volumes rose in first-quarter 2020, it was hurt by the cigarette industry’s rate of decline and retail share losses. While management withdrew its 2020 earnings view due to COVID-19-related uncertainties, it continues to expect domestic cigarette industry volumes to drop in 2020.

Nonetheless, pricing strategies and solid oral tobacco products continued aiding Altria during the quarter, wherein top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. Management highlighted that it hasn’t seen any material disruptions from coronavirus and is focused on strengthening its cash position amid the crisis.

Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is one of the top 10 stocks among hedge funds. Actually Facebook ranked #1 for most of 2019 until it settled at #2 at the end of December. Facebook shares also returned more than 2% this year, so, we really like Facebook. However, when we read legendary value investor Bill Miller's 2020 Q1 investor letter, his reasoning made perfect sense. In the following video you can watch why Bill Miller thinks it doesn't make sense today to invest in Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and 6 other recession stocks that performed well so far this year.

Bill Miller is no ordinary investor. His hedge fund returned 120% in 2019. Bill Miller came to fame for beating the S&P 500 Index for 15 straight years when he was at Legg Mason.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/08/where-will-pinterest-be-in-5-years.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,GOOG,2020-05-08T00:00:00,"Pinterest's (NYSE:PINS) stock recently plummeted after the company posted mixed first-quarter numbers. Its revenue grew 35% annually to $272 million and beat estimates by $1 million, but its adjusted net loss widened from $40 million to $60 million, or $0.10 per share, which missed expectations by a penny.

Pinterest didn't offer any guidance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it warned that its gross margins would contract as the cost of supporting new users overwhelmed its growth in ad revenue, and its operating expenses would rise. In other words, investors should expect slower revenue growth with wider losses.

Investors clearly weren't pleased with that grim outlook, but is Pinterest still a good long-term investment? Let's take a look at Pinterest's past growth, its plans for the future, and where the stock could end up in five years.

How fast is Pinterest growing?

Pinterest went public last April at $19 per share, but the stock dipped below its IPO price following its latest report. Pinterest's full-year revenue rose 51% in 2019, as its global monthly active users (MAUs) grew 26% to 335 million.

Pinterest's MAUs rose another 26% year over year to 367 million in the first quarter. Its international MAUs climbed 34% to 277 million, and its U.S. MAUs grew 6% to 90 million, but it still generates significantly less average revenue per user (ARPU) overseas.

Wall Street expects Pinterest's revenue to rise just 14% this year due to the pandemic and other macro pressures, but accelerate to 34% growth next year as those headwinds wane. Pinterest is expected to remain unprofitable this year, but possibly generate a slim non-GAAP profit by 2021.

Investors shouldn't put too much faith in those long-term estimates, since the fallout from COVID-19 remains hard to quantify. Nonetheless, Pinterest will likely face sluggish growth this year as advertisers rein in their spending and rising expenses turn its growth in users into a double-edged sword.

What are Pinterest's long-term goals?

Pinterest carved out a niche in the crowded social networking market with virtual pinboards that showcased a user's hobbies and interests.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) chased Pinterest with Instagram's collections and the new Hobbi app, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google challenged Pinterest with a ""Collections"" feature for saving images and search results -- but none of those efforts has curbed Pinterest's growth yet.

To differentiate its platform, Pinterest launched ""shoppable"" pins and allowed retailers to upload their entire catalogs. Last year, Cowen & Co. claimed 48% of Pinterest's users used the platform to find and shop for products, compared to just 14% of Facebook's users and 10% of Instagram's users.

Pinterest is well suited for apparel, home goods, and travel, since users can passively convince their followers to buy the same products or experiences. That cycle is arguably more organic than the creation of targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google, and makes it a potential leader in the ""social shopping"" space. Its long-standing partnership with Shopify, which allows smaller merchants to sell their products on Pinterest, could complement that growth.

Another top priority for Pinterest is the improved monetization of its international users, who now account for over three-quarters of its MAUs. Its international ARPU jumped 76% annually to $0.13 last quarter, but that was dwarfed by its domestic ARPU, which grew 18% to $2.66. Closing that gap could require some margin-crushing investments.

Pinterest also wants to diversify its ads away from the apparel, home, and travel sectors, while encouraging users to pin more videos. Those efforts could strengthen its defenses against fierce rivals like Instagram, which also offers shoppable posts on its larger platform.

A promising company with a lot to prove

Pinterest is still growing, but its losses are widening and its stock isn't cheap at about eight times this year's projected sales. Facebook, which is firmly profitable, trades at less than 8 times this year's sales.

Pinterest's MAUs could continue rising over the next five years, but the costs of maintaining that growing user base could offset its ad revenue and make it tough to ever generate a profit. Meanwhile, the expansion of the nascent social shopping market could eliminate Pinterest's first mover's advantage as other platforms promote their shoppable posts. Its overseas growth could decelerate as regional competitors launch similar apps.

In short, Pinterest is a promising company that still has a lot to prove. I believe it could head higher over the next five years, but constant pressure from competitors and concerns about its losses could prevent it from outperforming its bigger industry peers."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saudi-wealth-fund-exploring-investment-152606009.html,FB,2020-05-08T15:26:06+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund is exploring a potential investment in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s digital unit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The Public Investment Fund is considering purchasing a minority stake in Jio Platforms, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Deliberations are ongoing and might not lead to a transaction, the people said.

Representatives for Reliance and PIF didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Any new investment into Jio Platforms will add to the $8 billion deal run that billionaire Mukesh Ambani has sealed in the past weeks. Facebook Inc. last month agreed to pay $5.7 billion for a 10% stake in the digital unit, while Silver Lake Partners and Vista Equity Partners this week said they would invest about $2.25 billion in total.

Reliance is also in talks with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. to sell an estimated $15 billion stake in its oil-and-chemicals business. The Indian conglomerate last week reassured investors that the discussions are still on course as the crude oil crash sparked by the pandemic spurred skepticism over the negotiations.

The PIF, once a holding company for government stakes in domestic businesses, had its mandate broadened in 2015 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to include international investments to support economic diversification. The sovereign wealth fund is looking into “any opportunity” arising from the economic wreckage of the crisis, said the fund’s governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan at a virtual event last month. The fund expects to see “lots of opportunities,” he said, citing airlines, energy and entertainment companies as examples

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-apologizes-role-sri-lankan-210228812.html,FB,2020-05-12T21:02:28+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s lack of a serious response to signs of abuse on its platform in Sri Lanka may have helped stoke deadly violence in the country in 2018, according to an investigation of the social network’s operations there. The company released a summary of the findings Tuesday, along with other independent assessments of the service’s impact on human rights in Indonesia and Cambodia.

“We deplore this misuse of our platform,” the company said in a response to the Sri Lanka report. “We recognize, and apologize for, the very real human rights impacts that resulted.” Facebook also highlighted actions it has taken to address the problems, including hiring content moderators with local language skills, implementing technology that automatically detects signs of hate speech and keeps abusive content from spreading, and trying to deepen relationships with local civil society groups.

The report on Sri Lanka details Facebook’s failure to respond to almost a decade of warnings about misuse of its platform from groups within the country. In 2018, a viral video falsely purporting to show a Muslim restaurateur admitting to mixing “sterilization pills” into the food of Sinhala-Buddhist men may have contributed to unrest and physical harm.

Facebook’s poor track record on human rights in international markets has been a black mark on the company for years. As it expanded rapidly, it staffed local operations in far-off countries with skeleton crews or not at all, making it unresponsive to the specific forms of local manipulation, according to the reports. Facebook’s decision to design algorithms that encourage more engagement also made it vulnerable to disinformation and incitement to violence. Human rights advocates have pushed the company to release assessments like the ones it shared Tuesday.

This is not the first Facebook apology. A 2018 assessment of its operations in Myanmar found it partly to blame for violence in that country. One response was to hire activist Miranda Sissons as the first Facebook director of human rights, last year. According to Sissons, Facebook has begun to conduct more country-by-country reviews of its performance on human rights, and will begin releasing reports regularly. She didn’t lay out a timeline, and declined to say which countries the company is studying.

The recently-released reports, which cover a similar time period as the Myanmar assessment, describe Facebook’s impact as complicated. Having access to the social network often increased freedom of speech and gave marginalized communities a new way to communicate. But governments also used Facebook to identify dissidents and spread misinformation. Groups looking to stoke communal violence found the social network to be fertile ground for recruitment and incitement.

Article One Advisors LLC, the consultant that conducted the assessments into Sri Lanka and Indonesia, found significant improvement at Facebook. “There has been a very big cultural shift -- a very welcome cultural shift,” said Chloe Poynton, a co-founder and principal at the firm. Facebook has implemented many of the group's suggestions related to content moderation and slowing the spread of abusive messaging. It is still considering some others, like Article One’s call for the company to appoint a member of its board of directors to be specifically responsible for human rights, according to Sissons.

The company's products may still pose a challenge going forward -- particularly end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp. Viral misinformation on the messaging service has already stoked violence and deaths in India, and while Facebook has started to fight this by limiting some message forwarding, the company's inability to read encrypted messages makes it difficult to spot potentially dangerous activity.

The assessment of Cambodia was conducted by Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit consulting firm. It found no significant failures, but highlighted challenges Facebook faced engaging with a repressive political system. It urged Facebook to push the country’s government to pass more humane regulations for social media, and to call out issues such as surveillance.

Sissons said Facebook was grappling with its responsibilities in such situations. “These are among the most difficult questions companies face,” she said. “We are prepared to engage with this question, but we don’t have answers to signal yet.”

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is opening some of its U.S. stores, with precautionary measures, starting next week.

The company confirmed to CNBC on Friday that it will reopen stores in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama and Alaska next week. The majority of Apple’s stores outside of China have been closed since March.

Apple AAPL shares were up 1.1% on Friday to $309.10.

The company plans to institute safety measures at the stores that reopen, including temperature checks, face coverings for employees, and allowing a limited number of customers at once into the stores. The stores will focus primarily on making repairs to Apple products.

“Our new social distance protocol allows for a limited number of visitors in the store at one time so there may be a delay for walk-in customers. We recommend, where possible, customers buy online for contactless delivery or in-store pick up,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.

Apple has six stores between Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama and Alaska, and 271 stores in the U.S. overall.

The store closures have been part of a sinking demand picture for Apple as it navigates the impact of the pandemic.

Although the company did not issue specific guidance for the current quarter, Apple executives told shareholders last week that sales of iPhones and wearables are likely to worsen in the June quarter due to the store closures.

Sales of Macbooks and iPads are likely to improve, Apple said, given demand for devices most relevant to the shelter-at-home environment.

Apple shares are up 3% year to date.

(NFLX) missed quarterly earnings estimates after the closing bell on April 21. The stock declined toward its quarterly pivot at $393.38 and then popped higher again. The stock is thus consolidating above this level and its all-time intraday high of $449.52 set on April 16.

The streaming video giant knows that content is king. And Netflix spends a fortune to stay on top. Global subscribers are on the rise as households around the world are on lockdown due to COVID-19. The stock is not cheap, as its P/E ratio is elevated at 88.37 without offering a dividend, according to Macrotrends.

Netflix stock closed last week at $435.55, up 34.6% year to date and in bull market territory at 50.1% above its March 17 low of $290.25. The stock is just 3.1% below its all-time intraday high of $449.52 set on April 16. The earnings miss from Netflix ended a winning streak of eight consecutive quarters in which it had beaten estimates.

The daily chart for Netflix

Refinitiv XENITH

The daily chart for Netflix shows that the stock traded on both sides of its 200-day simple moving average before breaking out to the upside on April 13 as a setup that favored a positive reaction to earnings released on April 21. The stock has been above a golden cross since Jan. 31, when the 50-day simple moving average rose above the 200-day simple moving average to indicate that higher prices would follow.

The test of the 200-day simple moving average at $323.18 on March 13 proved to be a buying opportunity. This led to the all-time high of $449.52 set on April 16. Since this high, the stock has held its quarterly pivot at $393.38 on weakness.

The weekly chart for Netflix

Revinitiv XENITH

The weekly chart for Netflix is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $397.50. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or ""reversion to the mean,"" at $259.90.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week rising to 78.79, up from 75.80 on May 1. This reading will likely be overbought this week with a reading above 80.00 on a scale of 00.00 to 100.00. Note that, at the September 2019 low, the stochastic reading was 9.63, below the 10.00 threshold, which defines a stock that is technically ""too cheap to ignore.""

Trading strategy: Buy Netflix shares on weakness to the monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual value levels at $400.16, $393.38, $381.22, and $314.45.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.

The second quarter 2020 level was established based upon the March 31 close, and the monthly level for May was established based upon the April 30 close. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week, and new quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year, while annual levels remain in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered ""too cheap to ignore,"" which is typically followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-violence-curbs-thwarted-groups-162417815.html,FB,2020-05-12T16:24:17+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- When President Donald Trump urged Americans last month to “LIBERATE VIRGINIA” on Twitter, a private Facebook group named “Boogaloo Enthusiasts: CORONAPOCALYPSE” welcomed the tweet.

“Did Trump just call for boogaloo?,” one member wrote, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Well, you heard the man! Let’s go bois,” another responded.

Membership in Facebook groups focused on violent anti-government uprisings in the U.S. has doubled in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has spread and governments impose restrictions aimed at slowing the contagion.

To get their message across, these groups are exploiting loopholes in Facebook anti-violence policies -- using satire, code words and other tactics that mask their motives, according to experts who follow fringe groups on social media. One of the more common such phrases is “boogaloo,” which can refer to a kind of music but more recently has come to describe a pending civil war.

The boogaloo groups, and other extremist groups deploying similar tactics, pose yet another test for the Menlo Park, California-based social media giant, as it tries to strike a workable balance between allowing free discourse and curbing disinformation or those encouraging violence and law breaking.

Facebook’s efforts to fight everything from Covid-19 misinformation to animal trafficking have been made more difficult by the company’s push into more private, encrypted communication, which can make some illicit activity almost impossible to detect -- a trade-off that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said he’s willing to accept. And though Facebook has delayed other content moderation to focus on pandemic-related material, Facebook groups have continued to promote fake cures and protests to reopen states that could violate social distancing mandates.

Facebook’s challenge has been highlighted by the lockdown protests -- a fringe movement that the “boogaloo” and other far-right groups have leveraged as a recruiting tool, experts say. Between February and April, the number of boogaloo Facebook groups grew from about 75 to 125, according to an April report by the Tech Transparency Project. Membership doubled to 70,000 in a monthlong period ending in late April, according to the report.

“The platforms’ own practices and design create these loopholes that allow disinformation conspiracy theories and radicalizations to exist. What you’re seeing with boogaloo is an example of that,” said Karen Kornbluh, senior fellow and director at the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund. “They are able to pretty clearly violate the terms of service through such simple, obvious strategies, which shows that there’s a lot of tightening up that can be done.”

Facebook and Instagram updated their violence and incitement policy on May 1 to prohibit the use of boogaloo terms when they are accompanied by statements and images depicting armed violence, according to a spokeswoman. She declined to provide a time frame for when they would fully take effect.

More broadly, Facebook is increasingly removing content “connected to organized hate” according to a May 12 blog post. The social media company said it removed 4.7 million pieces of such content from January through March -- 3 million more than it had in the preceding quarter.

Facebook is aware that groups try to hide from their detection efforts, which include user flagging, artificial intelligence and human reviewers, the spokeswoman said. For example, the term “boogaloo” doesn’t always refer to civil war -- it also refers to a music genre, which means Facebook has to review boogaloo uses in context, according to the spokeswoman. It’s also a “wink-wink, nudge-nudge” reference to the 1984 breakdancing movie “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” according to Alice Marwick, an assistant professor of media and technology at the University of North Carolina.

Other Facebook groups attempt to hide by posting images that obscure problematic images or using words that would otherwise flag Facebook’s search tools by writing them in other languages, such as using Roman characters for Arabic words, according to another Facebook representative.

A team of 350 people -- including experts in law enforcement, national security and radicalizations -- studies trends in speech related to violence that lead to real-world harm, including how groups use veiled language to hide their activity, the representatives said. Facebook has also commissioned independent research to monitor shifts across the internet in order to crack down on violent content masked by humor or sarcasm, the representatives said.

With the proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices, apps have emerged as an integral part of the tech economy. Over five million apps are available for download via Apple (AAPL) iTunes app store, the Google Play Store, or Amazon (AMZN) in dozens of categories.

Some apps help people manage their finances, and some provide up-to-the-minute news of the world. Others act as a GPS, allow users to shop at their favorite stores from their phones, take pictures, send messages around the world, find somebody to date within a five-block radius, or find the best nearby bar or restaurant. Whatever you can imagine, there is probably an app for that.

Apps of all kinds have become ubiquitous, and the majority of mobile device owners use multiple apps daily. Some apps have become hugely popular, leading to success and wealth for the developers, bringing in millions or even billions of dollars. These success stories, however, are the exception, not the rule.

Key Takeaways Most app developers work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by.

Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019, though a huge majority of that revenue went to large tech companies.

While some do strike it rich, an average hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes.

The unfortunate truth is that most app developers will work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by in a world of ever-increasing competition and consumers with short attention spans.

Understanding Getting Rich Creating Apps

Some free apps generate revenue via in-app purchases or advertising, while others are purchased. The good news for both kinds of apps is that people use them a whole lot. ComScore's Global State of Mobile 2019 found that more than seven out of every eight minutes spent on mobile devices is app-related.

The bad news is that ComScore also found the majority of mobile device users download no new apps each month. There is, however, a small set of around 7% of smartphone users who download apps like crazy, accounting for nearly half of all monthly downloads.

Apps can be a huge source of profits. Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019. These days, there are tens of thousands of developers working independently, with start-ups, or with established companies to come up with the next big app.

The competition to develop a successful app is fierce, and there's no guarantee that even a great idea executed well will catch on and bring financial success. Even though some apps have made millionaires out of their creators, most app developers do not strike it rich, and the chances of making it big are depressingly small.

Successes

First, it is worth noting that the most popular apps—rated by unique visitors per month—are owned and operated by large technology firms like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).

There have been a few instances of small apps generating big success and making their creators exceedingly rich. Some apps have been snatched up by larger companies for huge sums of money, for example when Facebook bought Instagram, Onavo, and WhatsApp.

Square, the point of sale app, has a market cap of $32.9 billion as of mid-2020. Snapchat has a market cap of $26.15 billion. Uber and Lyft have caps of $54.6 billion and over $9.35 billion, respectively. Airbnb was worth over $38 billion at the end of 2019.

Challenges

While those valuations and sales numbers may seem encouraging, don't be fooled: the average app developer is unlikely to strike it rich. According to Forbes, the average app developer produces between three and five apps, each app bringing in an average revenue of $1,125 on Google's platform and $4,000 on Apple's.

A hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes. And that doesn't account for the money, time, and effort invested in creating those apps.

With those small revenue potentials, it is hard to build a team of developers and create advertising and marketing campaigns to increase recognition and drive downloads. There is also a huge amount of competition. For every category of app, there are numerous options to choose from, and making yours the one to gain traction can be hit or miss.

On top of all that, even with a hugely successful app, there is no guarantee that it will be able to produce a profit. It is increasingly difficult to monetize activities that many people have come to expect to be free—such as messaging, social networking, photo sharing, and cloud storage."

Chicago, IL – May 5, 2020 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Electronic Arts EA as the Bull of the Day, Boot Barn BOOT asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Facebook FB and Twitter TWTR.



Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

Electronic Arts, aka EA, is unquestionably ‘in the game’ during this global pandemic. Casual and dedicated gamers alike are glued to their screens across the globe, providing a rare tailwind to this video game powerhouse. Analysts have been increasing their EPS estimates for the next few years, pushing EA into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Business

EA has been a dominant player in video game development since the inception of modern video games in the 80s. EA is best known for its iconic life simulation game The Sims, as well as its lineup of leading sports games like FIFA, Madden, and NHL, which are released annually. The firm has a broad portfolio of world-renown video games that continue to drive its topline.

EA and its innovative management team have been successful in transitioning from physical video games to a digitally-driven & subscription-service model. EA still relies on new video game releases for revenue growth, but EA’s live services now makeup over 50% of the company’s sales and are expected to be a primary topline driver moving forward. These live services include subscription services that allow gamers to play a select catalog of games for a monthly fee as well as esports.

EA is a major player in esports, a new digitally competitive ‘sport’ where gaming enthusiasts can watch their favorite gamers compete in the video games that they know and love. According to Influencer Marketing Hub, this fast-growing industry is expected to be worth $1.65 billion by next year, with a compounded annual growth rate of over 27%. EA is well-positioned to corner a sizable portion of this market with its essential esports games: Apex Legends, FIFA, Madden NFL, as well as globally sponsored events & competitions.

The stay-at-home initiative is conditioning our society to rely on digital entertainment like video games for a daily release. I suspect that this uptick in gaming will continue into the post-pandemic world.

We are on the verge of a new wave of mobile gaming, which will be driven by cloud technology. 5G is going to be the primary catalyst that makes this form of gaming possible, with its hyper-fast connectivity. EA is partnering with Google Stadia to make its games available through Stadia’s cloud platform. I suspect that EA will be partnering with more cloud gaming innovators like Microsoft and Nvidia as high-quality mobile gaming gains traction.

Societies’ new normal will be playing more video games, and the next generation of gaming consoles that are anticipated to be released in the 2020 holiday season gives me even more cause to be bullish on EA long-term potential.

Financials

EA has a volatile top and bottom line that tend to be cyclically correlated to game releases, but the rise of its live services segment should curb some of the volatility into consistent growth. EA Sports’ annual versions of FIFA, Madden, and NHL provide some reliability in sales figures each year, but the yearly improvements are becoming increasingly marginal.

This enterprise is well-capitalized with $5.6 billion in cash & equivalents, making up more than its total liabilities on the balance sheet. The company has very little debt on the books and robust growing cash flows that are more than enough to finance its innovative operations and attractive investment opportunities.

Tonight’s Earnings Release

EA is releasing its March quarter earnings after close tonight. This should provide us with a clearer picture of how the company has benefited from the increased engagement and whether this pandemic tailwind will continue in the post-pandemic world.

I would be hesitant to put a position on these shares before the quarterly results are released tonight because of the stock’s recent run-up. Investors may be ready to pull profits off the table amid the economic uncertainty.

According to Zacks Consensus estimates, we are looking for an EPS of $0.98 on sales of $1.17 billion, which would represent a YoY decline on both metrics. Focus on management’s discussion of future expectations and investments for clues on where the company is headed. Any direct mention of guidance will likely be the catalyst for any substantial price action if provided.

Story continues

Key Takeaways

EA is a robust long-term investment for your portfolio of the future. This company has driven innovation for decades, and I anticipate that it will continue to do so in the years to come. The savvy management team continues to stay ahead of the innovation curve. The next generation of gaming consoles, as well as the rise of esports, should position EA for robust growth in the coming years.

Bear of the Day:

Boot Barn was actually a healthy growing company coming into this pandemic-driven economic slowdown, but this natural disaster triggered a rude awakening for this working-class retailer. BOOT shares have plummeted over 60% for 2020 thus far, as investors price out this stocks potential.

The stock had driven up over 500% since Q4 of 2017 as the company runway of growth kept extending, but unfortunately, it looks like the company may have overextended itself. Analysts have been decreasing their EPS estimates in both the near and long-term, pushing BOOT into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

The Pandemic’s Impact

Just to be entirely transparent off the bat, I am not recommending that you bet against shares of BOOT, I am merely saying these shares may still be in trouble, despite losing most of their value from January.

Boot Barn is retail that sells functional workwear to those in working-class jobs such as construction, manufacturing, oil & gas, electric/plumbing, and agriculture. These are the industries that are seeing some of the most significant employment cutbacks.

This enterprise has a considerable strategic presence in key oil regions around the US, and the massive hit that this industry has taken is going to ripple into Boot Barn’s financials.

Loss of employment and job uncertainty is going to substantially hamper demand for Boot Barn products. It will be years before these industries reach full employment again (if they ever do), and I suspect that this will strain demand for Boot Barn in the coming years.

Boot Barn had been aggressively expanding its western presence with an increasing number of big-box brick-and-mortar storefronts averaging 11,000 square feet. The company currently operates 264 stores in 33 states, representing a 50% storefront increase in the past 5 years. I think they may have overextended themselves. The overhead from its enormous storefronts may be Boot Barn’s undoing.

Financial Situation

The business’s paper-thin margins, combined with massive inventory levels, is quite concerning to me. Boot Barn will likely be forced to sell its products at a sizable discount to clear some of its inventory. This will weigh heavily on its already tight margins. I suspect we will see some negative EPS results in the coming quarters.

The company had, in the past, been able to rely on its cash flows to support operations, but I do not believe that this will be possible in the coming quarters. As of December 31st, 2019, Boot Barn had $45 million in cash and will likely need to dig into its revolving lines of credit to maintain operations.

Glimpse of Hope

Boot Barn has a small ecommerce presence (making up just over 15% of its sales), unlike a lot of its cohorts. Boot Barn stores are largely located in rural areas, which are expected to see an increase in brick-and-mortar foot-traffic more quickly than non-rural regions. These two silver-linings could be this retailer’s saving grace, but uncertainty remains high, and I would still stay away from BOOT shares.

Key Takeaways

This unprecedented global pandemic has been able to turn a seemingly healthy growing company on its head. There is still hope for this rural retailer, but it is up to management to navigate these murky economic waters. For now, I would keep my distance from these shares until we get more color on management’s strategy to get through this highly uncertain period.

Post-Earnings, Which Stock Is Better: Alphabet or Facebook?

Considering the fact that Alphabet and Facebook, like everybody else, are in the middle of a global pandemic, their earnings reports were okay. The current quarter and the quarters thereafter will be more difficult for these companies as a battered global economy struggles to get back into equilibrium.

So what was there in the just-reported quarter (and overall) that can perhaps help us decide whether we might want to buy some shares?

Overall Results Weren’t Too Bad

Alphabet earnings $9.87 (Zacks Consensus $10.40, year-ago $11.90): miss, down 17.1%

Sales $33.707 billion (Zacks Consensus $32.587, year-ago $29.479): beat, up 14.3%

Facebook earnings $1.71 (Zacks Consensus $1.73, year-ago $0.85): miss, up 101.2%

Sales $17.737 billion (Zacks Consensus $17.286, year-ago $15.077): beat, up 17.6%

The primary concern as far as most investors are concerned is regarding the hit to ad revenue and the length of time this weakness may be expected to continue. Since both Alphabet and Facebook have a geographically widespread business that excludes China, they were both impacted by constricted ad budgets.

Ad Revenue Slowed In March

Alphabet’s total ad revenue grew 10% from 1Q 2019. YouTube ad revenues grew 33%, mainly because of very good growth in the first two months of the year that dropped off sharply in March, as brand advertisers cut back significantly, while direct response remained strong. APAC was the strongest region although U.S. and other Americas also grew.

Facebook also grew ad revenue 17% (or 19% on a currency-neutral basis), which is pretty good all things considered.

Asia/Pac was 5 points stronger that the rest. Usage (3 billion MAUs for the first time) and engagement (messaging, voice/video calling) both swelled, offsetting the drop in ad prices toward the end of the quarter.

The mobile newsfeed on Facebook was the biggest driver, due to prior product optimizations and increased engagement.

The company started seeing weakness in the second week of March, primarily from auto and travel operators, which is kind of not surprising. It did however see strength in gaming and what it called “relative stability” in technology and ecommerce (its largest served area). Weakness was more or less evenly spread between large and small players, and across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Rest of World.

Zuckerberg cautioned: “I don't expect that this exact spike in usage will sustain over a longer period of time.”

Both Companies Gained From Businesses Moving Online

In Alphabet’s case, this was reflected in its non-advertising revenue, including its Google Play Store that jumped 30% between February and March, Google Classroom that doubled to 100 million students and educators, an estimated 400% increase in Chromebook demand, its video conferencing software Meet now being used by companies like Twitter.

And of course it was also reflected in the increased use of Google Cloud where revenues jumped 52%, with strength across companies in retail, public sector, healthcare, gaming, media and communications companies, and other sectors for things like network analytics, customer service, demand forecasting, and disease monitoring and control.

More users are looking for businesses on Facebook and Instagram platforms amid lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders. Facebook is making the most of this trend by quickly creating store fronts and facilitating transactions. This helped its small business revenue. The company expects its personalized ad targeting and measurability of ad performance to help it grow its small business roster. It has also sweetened things by offering funding to this group as well as news providers that now have to operate on reduced ad budgets.

The primary driver of both revenue and earnings for Facebook and Alphabet was again advertisements, as the first two months were very strong. When ad revenues dropped off, the other side of the business picked up.

Expenses with an Eye to the Future

In addition to higher traffic acquisition cost and content acquisition cost (mostly for YouTube ad-supported business), Alphabet reported additional depreciation related to infrastructure build and R&D and S&M team building to support the growing Google Cloud business. There was also a provision for expected credit deterioration related to COVID.

Increased depreciation related to its infrastructure build was a factor for Facebook as well, but the 40% increase in its R&D was attributed to AR/VR product development. Facebook’s marketing costs also increased. It also made a provision for expected credit deterioration related to COVID.

Facebook is obviously strengthening its ecommerce and online delivery businesses, while building Oculus, which had a very strong quarter, in an attempt to offset the weakness in ad revenues that is bound to continue. Alphabet is working to improve the Google Cloud business even as several non-ad segments are growing strongly.

Outlooks Show Increased Caution

Alphabet is concerned about the higher level of depreciation, the cost of operating its technical infrastructure, as well as things like customer support and content review in a market where revenues are dependent on economic recovery. So it will be scaling back capex slightly to below 2019 levels and reduce hiring beginning in the third quarter, except in strategic areas. The silver lining management pointed out is that search tends to snap back very quickly once economic activity resumes.

Facebook withdrew revenue guidance for 2020 and lowered total expense target from $54-59 billion to $52-56 billion (including $300 million allotted to date to help the broader community). Still, weaker revenue is expected to result in a negative impact on the 2020 operating margin.

Conclusion

Both companies generate the bulk of their revenue from advertising, which may be expected to remain very weak right through the year. Moreover, while they are both in different stages of diversification and Alphabet is somewhat ahead of Facebook, with the billions coming from cloud, hardware, Play, etc, it’s still unlikely to move the needle for the company if ad revenue falls too far.

While some of its initiatives under “Other Bets” also look encouraging, they’re unlikely to have any material benefit this year. Facebook’s other revenue is miniscule, so doesn’t warrant much of a conversation yet.

But Facebook has signed an exciting new ecommerce deal, wherein WhatsApp will collaborate with India’s Reliance Jio, which has incredible opportunities for the future (I’ll leave that for another day). The business might take off this year too, since Jio is already testing its ecommerce platform.

Also, these are solid companies with huge cash generating potential (and balance sheet cash) that will bounce back quickly when the market does. They won’t be set back too much the way many others will, i.e., they are very low-risk.

That said, my hunch is there’s more room to fall, with further deterioration in results looking forward and especially considering that they’re slightly overvalued now, on most key metrics. So while nobody knows for sure what a stock will do, I’d wait to add position here.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-skips-forecast-says-covid-200638734.html,FB,2020-05-05T22:31:06+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Pinterest Inc. shares slumped after the company said the coronavirus outbreak hurt advertisers and triggered a revenue decline in April.

The online search and discovery company also did not issue guidance for the rest of the year. It tossed out its previous 2020 forecast last month.

“The spread of COVID-19 has certainly had an impact on our business and the businesses of our advertisers, but we remain optimistic about the future,” Todd Morgenfeld, chief financial officer of Pinterest, said in a statement.

April revenue fell 8% from a year earlier, Morgenfeld told analysts on a conference call. “Things like food and beverage, health and beauty had relatively better demand in the early part of this crisis,” he added. “But even those advertisers began to experience supply chain difficulties that had various impacts on their appetite for spend.”

Pinterest shares dropped 18% in extended trading, after closing at $20.81 in New York earlier on Tuesday.

Pinterest reported revenue of $272 million for the quarter, up 35% from a year ago and slightly better than average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The company also had 367 million monthly users in the quarter, 26% growth over a year ago and above Wall Street expectations, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg.

The company ended the quarter with $1.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and posted a net loss of $141 million for the period. It still plans to increase operational spending in the second quarter, but at a slower pace than the first three months of the year.

Pinterest is the latest digital advertising company to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales despite a hit to the business at the end of March when the coronavirus outbreak started to impact marketing budgets.

Unlike Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc., however, Pinterest did not say anything to alleviate concerns about the current state of its business. Facebook, for example, said revenue was “flat” in the first three weeks of April, a sign to some that the industry had stabilized since the initial shock from Covid-19 lockdowns.

https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-names-first-members-content-171101626.html,FB,2020-05-06T17:11:01+00:00,"EDITOR'S NOTE: Changed ""former head of state"" to ""former prime minister"" in the video description

Facebook on Wednesday named the first members of a new oversight board that will have final say in what content can appear on its sites.

The board's creation comes in response to criticism on how the social media giant handles problematic content.

Nick Clegg is the social network giant's vice president for global affairs and, in a Skype interview with Reuters, described the independent board as first-of-its-kind.

""I hope that any reasonable person will see that this is a genuine, sincere, earnest attempt to do something that has never happened before. This has never been established before. It is an experiment.""

Facebook said the first 20 members of the independent board will include a former Danish prime minister, a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Yemen, an American constitutional law scholar who testified at President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings, a former official with Israel's Justice Ministry, and a former editor-in-chief of the UK's Guardian newspaper.

Clegg says the board will be able to overturn Facebook's decisions on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram.

""And clearly, we don't always get that right. That then leads to users saying, hang on a minute, you've taken one of my posts down. A user can then appeal to the company. And if the user feels they haven't got satisfaction from that appeal, they can then take their cases to the oversight board.""

The board will oversee controversial cases relating strictly to content and not other areas, such as privacy.

Critics told Reuters the creation of the board is an encouraging step, but the real test would be in how it operates, and how much sway it ultimately has over the content of the site."

(NASDAQ: AMZN) as the e-commerce giant is looking to use it as a testing ground for its movies.

Why Cramer Thinks It Will Happen

AMC CEO Adam Aron is a ""miracle worker"" who could be working on a ""miracle"" by generating some value for investors through a buyout, according to Jim Cramer. The acquisition may not do much to help the movie theater chain over the long term, however, similar to Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.

All Amazon essentially did to change Whole Foods' business is the addition of lockers for delivery pickups, Cramer said: ""They didn't do much.""

Why Barrington Research Is Optimistic

The combined enterprise value of AMC is less than $5 billion with the majority of the value in the form of debt, Barrington Research analyst James Goss wrote in a note. As such, an acquisition by Amazon would ""clearly be relatively modest.""

Meanwhile, Dalian Wanda holds a 75% voting interest in AMC and its management involvement is ""described as fairly passive."" So the ultimate sale would be at their discretion.

From a regulatory point of view, Goss said Amazon buying AMC would pose fewer challenges than if one of the major studios was making the purchase. Amazon's ambitions to showcase its films on the big screen are ""much smaller"" and mostly focuses on TV series.

It remains to be seen if Amazon's control of a movie theater chain would generate long-term value given the ongoing COVID-19 threat and a questionable recovery in a post-pandemic world. Nevertheless, Goss said Amazon can throw AMC a ""lifeline"" backed by its own ""compatible interests"" and such a move would be an attractive option for investors.

AMC Price Action

X

After such a strong run, Facebook (FB) is possibly due for a pause, and given that it is such a strong stock, I can't see it pulling back too much. I'm expecting sideways action. As such, I would look at entering a butterfly trade for the June expiration period.

A butterfly is a neutral, income-oriented strategy. It is a limited-risk and limited-profit trade. But on a typical butterfly trade, the profit potential is higher than the potential loss.

Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all with the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.

A typical butterfly would be constructed as follows:

Buy one in-the-money call

Sell two at-the-money calls

Buy one out-of-the-money call

Let's take a look at how that might look on Facebook stock.

Buy one June 19 195 call at 21.30.

Sell two June 19 215 calls at 7.50.

Buy one June 19 235 call @ 1.25.

The total cost of this trade is $755 and that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.

Maximum Gain And Risk

The maximum gain is $1,245, which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($2,000 less $755).

The breakeven prices are 202.55 and 227.45 (215 plus and minus 12.45)

A butterfly options trade has a tent-like shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. It's important to keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.

A good aim for a butterfly trade is to make a 20% return on capital at risk. In this case that would be around $150.

Butterfly spreads can be a bit confusing for beginners, so it's best to paper trade this way and see how it performs.

Facebook is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a Relative Strength Rating of 87, on a 1-99 scale with 99 tops. It also has a Composite Rating of 98 and an EPS Rating of 96.

Facebook is currently trading above its 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages and those moving averages are sloping upward. That's generally a bullish sign.

However, there is overhead resistance from the January high around 225 and it's hard to see too much further upside from here in the short-term.

Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

“It’s been the small caps that actually outperformed percentage wise last week, and a big part of the reason is that there are a bunch of stocks in that area that are really, I think going to be the ones to look at as we see this seismic shift that's happened because of the pandemic,” says Michele Schneider, MarketGauge director of trading education and research, told Yahoo Finance.

Schneider says small cap companies with strong earnings and good financials can “fill the void” in a behavioral shift that’s happening as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Which would be where the change is in technology, where the change is in everything that we do,” said Schneider. “How we consume, how we shop, how we go to restaurants, go to the movies, how we travel.”

“Some of the classic stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), et cetera, they're kind of almost pre-historic in a way in that they are saturated mathematically. You wonder how much more they have to go,” she added.

Schneider is also bullish on silver [SI=F], gold [GC=F] and other commodities, given the risk of stagflation in the future.

“We haven't quite gotten there yet [stagflation], but I do believe very strongly that that's a distinct possibility going forward,” said Schneider. “I'm looking at it more end of this year, maybe into 2021. We already started accumulating positions for that.”

Stagflation is commonly defined as persistent high inflation along with high unemployment and a stagnant economy. The term became popular in the U.S. during the 1970s when oil prices surged during rampant inflation and high unemployment.

Schneider notes similarities between both periods, with the exception of oil prices.

“I do believe that we're in a situation where we can keep the recessionary environment, and see these agriculturals — we're already seeing reflected a bit in gold and the miners — start going up,” said Schneider.

Gold exchange-traded funds have attracted $14.5 billion in less than five months, according to Bloomberg data. The 2020 inflows into ETF’s tracking gold surpass any full year on record, even as stocks have rallied since their March 52-week lows.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technology-solid-footing-5-stocks-105910549.html,FB,2020-05-07T10:59:10+00:00,"Tech stocks have been investors’ darlings this year despite the coronavirus outbreak. In fact, social distancing norms enacted globally to mitigate the spread of the virus compelled people to stay at home, binge online and work as well as learn from home.

This new lifestyle has boosted various corners of the technology sector, ranging from enterprise cloud computing, cyber security, remote communications, video gaming and e-commerce to online payments. The broader tech ETF Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK has gained 19.3% past month versus 15.3% gains in the S&P 500.

Has the Rally Been Uninterrupted?

Sailing hasn’t been all that smooth for the tech sector so far as it also hit some rough waters in between. President Donald Trump’s forewarning of a temporary suspension of immigration due to virus spread dealt a blow to the tech stocks in mid-April. The U.S. tech sector is heavily reliant on immigrants.

Then, there was a sharp drop (down 7.6%) in shares of Amazon AMZN on May 1 due to earnings weakness and weak outlook. Since Amazon was one of the key contributors of the April rally, such underperformance wasn’t taken lightly by investors. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq took a beating to start the month.

Have Patience, Tech Appears to Have More Room to Run

Forget Amazon as we already had a bunch of inspiring big tech earnings this season from the likes of Facebook FB, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.

Some corners of the technology industry – cloud computing, internet and video gaming – are already benefiting from the stay-at-home trends. But those corners that were the social-distancing victims may also turn around with the full reopening of economies.

One such area is smartphones. Micron Technology MU — one of the world’s largest producers of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips that are the key building blocks in smartphones and cloud computing technologies — lately indicated that demand for smartphones in China has started to rebound post-coronavirus lockdown. This is great news for semiconductor companies as well as the likes of Apple AAPL. Apple CEO Tim Cook also took notice of recovering demand in China through April.

Widening the presence and stepping beyond the core operation has become the big tech companies’ mantra in recent times. In a bid to be part of the hot video-gaming industry (which has seen immense growth amid lockdowns), Facebook too launched its first game streaming app, Facebook Gaming, on Apr 21. Such initiatives will pay off in the medium term.

Strong Fundamentals of the Tech Sector

Tech earnings are likely to grow 2.8% in Q1 of 2020 on 6.2% higher revenues. This is in contrast to a 12.5% slump in S&P 500 earnings on 2.1% increase in revenues. The technology sector is among the very few outperformers in the otherwise-downbeat earnings trends.

Tech companies are cash-rich. Microsoft has been the most cash-rich company globally, with about $137.6 billion in cash balance. Tech sector’s debt profile is also impressive. Debt/equity ratio of the sector is 0.15x versus 0.72x of the S&P 500-based ETF IVV.

Tech Stocks That May See More Upside

These stocks have seen the upcoming quarter’s earnings estimates going up by at least 5% in the past four weeks. Their price as a percentage of 52-week high-low (H-L) range remains lesser than or equal to 90%. A value of 100 indicates that the stock is trading at a 52-week high and vice versa. The past four-week share price rally is greater than equal to 15%. The stocks also have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

All six of its theme parks around the world are closed. Its cruise ships are docked. Live sports are gone from ESPN, and movie theaters are closed, while live-action film production has gone on pause, cutting off its studio entertainment division at both ends.

Disney revealed its quarterly numbers for the first time since the pandemic started, and they weren't pretty. Though revenue actually rose 21% to $18 billion, largely because of its acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox last March, segment operating income, which excludes certain corporate costs, was down 37% to $2.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share plunged from $1.61 to $0.60.

The threat of the coronavirus going forward was enough to make the company take on nearly $7 billion in debt and add another $5 billion to its credit facilities. Disney will also forego it semi-annual dividend payment in July, saving it approximately $1.6 billion, and furloughed about 100,000 employees on April 19, mostly from its parks staff.

Investors took the news in stride. The stock barely moved on the report, which may have been helped by news that Shanghai Disneyland would reopen next week, though at much lower capacity than normal.

Disney's commentary and the current reality of the coronavirus mean that the company is going to be feeling some kind of impact from the pandemic for at least the next few quarters, if not years. However, the stock still looks like a winner for long-term investors.

The brand value isn't going anywhere

Few brands enjoy the kind of customer loyalty and enduring relationships that Disney does. Ranked #10 by Interbrand on its list of Best Global Brands with an estimated brand value of $44.4 billion, the company has arguably more multi-generational brand power than any other company. The love for the nearly century-old Disney, its movies, theme parks, and other products is passed down from one generation to the next, shared among parents, children, and grandparents. Though the company has plenty of competitors, there's no true peer when it comes to children's and family entertainment around the world, or the magic and happiness that the Disney brand represents.

Former CEO and now Chairman Bob Iger put his finger on this on the earnings call when he said:

""In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They missed doing the things they enjoy, things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends. Whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN, people want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people's lives.""

Disney's businesses -- theme parks, movies, and sports -- are timeless passions, and will almost certainly benefit form pent-up demand when it is safe to enjoy them again. Even during the pandemic, the draw of Disney's assets is as clear as ever. On ESPN, its coverage of the NFL Draft saw a 58% jump in viewership from last year, and The Last Dance, the ten-part documentary about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, has become the most-watched ESPN documentary ever and the #1 program in the U.S. among all key male demographics. Those results indicate sports fans badly miss live sports. Similarly, The Disney Family Singalong, which aired April 16, garnered more than 13 million views, topping TV ratings the night it aired and again showing the strength of the Disney family of brands and customer loyalty. Disney has another sing-along planned for Mother's Day.

While Disney's business is temporarily crippled by the pandemic, it's not at risk of being disrupted the way businesses like brick-and-mortar retail are, and Americans and others suffering from the pandemic are clearly missing things like live sports, movies, and theme parks. There's little reason to doubt that demand for those things will bounce back when they are available again.

Meanwhile, the stay-at-home orders may be helping Disney rapidly grow its streaming business. The company revealed that Disney+ had reached 54.5 million subscribers as of May 4, while it continues to see growth at Hulu and ESPN+. Revenue at its direct-to-consumer and international segment jumped from $1.1 billion to $4.1 billion in the quarter, though it's expected to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. Just six months after its debut, Disney+, which is set to launch in Japan, several European countries, and Latin America in the coming months, has smashed growth expectations -- Disney had originally forecast that it would have 60 million-90 million subscribers by 2024. The company now looks well on pace to break into that range later this year.

With Hulu and ESPN+, Disney is emerging as the strongest challenger to Netflix's streaming supremacy, and the leading streamer now has a larger market cap than Disney.

Considering that Disney may have a streaming business on par with Netflix in just a few years, investors are essentially getting the rest of the business for free now. Though the coming months will be tough for the entertainment giant, pent-up demand, brand loyalty, and growth in streaming will eventually drive the stock to new heights."
https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/09/got-3000-invest-buy-these-3-warren-buffett-stocks.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,AAPL,2020-05-09T00:00:00,"During Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting last weekend, CEO Warren Buffett made the following pronouncement:

Stocks have an enormous advantage and ... if you bet on America, and sustain that position for decades, you're going to do better than, in my view far better than, owning Treasuries securities.

Since the legendary investor took the helm of Berkshire in 1965, it has generated compounded annual gains of more than 20%, and by the end of 2019, it had increased in value by a massive 2,744,062%. Given his track record, investors could do far worse than follow the example of the Oracle of Omaha.

In times like these, making sure that your emergency fund is topped off should be a high priority. But if you've done that and still have some free cash leftover that you don't expect to need for the next three to five years -- $3,000 for example, though any amount will do -- now's a good time to invest in strong businesses. And among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, I think these three, in particular, have plenty of room to run in the years to come.

1. Visa

If there's one industry that's a no-brainer when it comes to periods of economic uncertainty, it's probably payment processing. Even with consumers reining in their spending to get through the tough times, they still have essential purchases to make, and no company is better positioned to benefit from that spending than Visa (NYSE:V).

The payments leader accounted for 53% of U.S. credit card network purchase volume, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in payments processed in 2018 -- dwarfing its three largest rivals combined. Perhaps even more importantly, unlike several of its primary competitors, Visa doesn't lend money. That represents a huge advantage at a time when unemployment is clocking in at a staggering 14.7% and the risk of credit delinquency and default continues to ratchet higher.

Finally, the company still has a long road for growth ahead, particularly in international markets. Visa estimates that around the world, people still make about $21 trillion worth of purchases with cash each year, and there are nearly 2 billion consumers without payment accounts, giving the company a large, and potentially lucrative, market opportunity to tap for growth.

2. Apple

There's no denying that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In its fiscal second quarter, which ended March 28, the company eked out revenue gains of just 1% year over year, thanks to strength from its services and wearables segments. But iPhone sales -- the largest single contributor to Apple's top line -- slumped by 7%. To put that into context, revenue in its fiscal first quarter climbed 9%, while iPhone sales jumped 8%.

Yet all is not lost for Apple. In a somewhat prescient step, it recently reintroduced a lower-cost iPhone SE, a move it had been planning for some time. With a starting price of just $399, the device should appeal to budget-conscious smartphone shoppers who might otherwise have waited to upgrade.

Then there's Apple's services segment, where revenues rose 17% year over year to an all-time record last quarter, despite the coronavirus headwinds -- or perhaps aided by them. The success was broad-based, with record sales from the App Store, Apple Music, video, and cloud services, as well as across most countries. Clearly, the segment got a boost from consumers under stay-at-home orders.

The wearables, home, and accessories segment also had a record-setting quarter, with revenue up 23% year over year, led by strong demand for AirPods and the Apple Watch.

This stock is still selling at a discount to its pre-coronavirus levels, but once investors realize Apple isn't a company on the brink, that sale won't last long.

3. Amazon

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may not check all the boxes of the typical Buffett stock, the legendary investor's view on it is well-documented.

Amazon has ""far surpassed anything I would have dreamt could have been done. Because if I really felt it could have been done, I should have bought it,"" Buffett said back in 2018. ""I had no idea that it had the potential. I blew it.""

It's also worth noting that it wasn't Buffett who finally pulled the trigger on putting it into Berkshire's portfolio, but one of his top-level subordinates, likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.

After initially falling as the pandemic began to make its impact felt in the U.S., Amazon stock recovered those losses and kept rising, holding up far better than most stocks since mid-February. Year to date, it's now up by around 29%, while the S&P 500 is still down by around 9%. Amazon services, from e-commerce to streaming video, and from cloud computing to Twitch, have become indispensable to consumers and businesses alike during the pandemic.

The tech titan reported its first-quarter earnings last week, and the results were remarkable. Net sales climbed 26% to nearly $76 billion and the company generated $4 billion in operating profits, despite coronavirus-related headwinds. Amazon has a bold vision for adapting to these unprecedented conditions, and it plans to spend $4 billion in the coming quarter to reduce the danger of its employees contracting COVID-19 at work, or exposing customers to it. News of that massive outlay initially sent the stock downward, but it's classic Amazon to be looking far into the future.

E-commerce represented just 11% of the total retail sales in the U.S. and the trend continues to gain steam. The new customers and new spending Amazon has acquired during the pandemic will still be around long after the crisis recedes, with even more to come."

The post-coronavirus stock market rally has been powerful, in large part thanks to big-cap techs such as Apple stock and the four FANG internet giants. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are obvious coronavirus plays. Facebook stock and Google stock are seeing heavy usage, though ad spending is a concern. Apple stock delivered a surprise EPS gain, despite its exposure to coronavirus supply and demand issues.

Top Stocks To Buy And Watch

One way to find the best stocks is to look at their IBD Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

Netflix stock is at the top with a perfect 99 out of 99 Composite Rating. Amazon stock and Facebook stock both have 98 ratings. Alphabet stock has a 95 rating and Apple stock has a 90 rating.

Investors should be focusing on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher but it isn't the only metric investors should keep track of.

Apple stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Facebook stock, Google stock and AAPL stock are on SwingTrader.

Facebook Stock

Facebook is the FANG stock closest to being actionable as it forms a cup base with a 224.30 entry point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The FB stock base is 39% deep. Largely that's above what investors should typically be after. But it's not unusual following the huge stock market crash. Facebook stock edged up 0.5% to 212.35 on Friday, climbing 5% for the week.

The relative strength line for Facebook stock is already at new highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500.

On April 29, Facebook reported first-quarter earnings that were mostly in line with expectations. Monthly active users climbed 10% to 2.6 billion as the users logged on the social media site to stay connected amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the company also warned that the increased user activity wouldn't protect it from the pullback it's seeing in online advertising revenue.

Google Stock

The next FANG stock closest to being actionable is Google, which is forming a cup base and closing in on a 1,530.84 buy point. Google stock had fallen 34% from its high on March 23 as fears rose over the Covid-19 outbreak. But the RS line for GOOGL stock hit a new high Friday.

Google stock rose 1.1% to 1,384.34 on Friday, also up 5% for the week.

The parent of Google reported mixed Q1 results last month as advertising revenue from the travel, auto and retail sectors fell. But YouTube revenue rose 33% to $4.038 billion, while Google Cloud revenue surged 52%.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock is extended from either a 383.11 buy point or 393.62 entry. During the bear market, NFLX stock fell more than 26% from a 52-week high in early March.

The FANG stock reported mixed Q1 financial results but it added 15.77 million new subscribers, crushing the 8.2 million subscribers analysts expected. Users went wild for its ""Tiger King"" documentary series, making it the most-streamed show in America in April, according to data analytics firm Parrot Analytics. ""Ozark,"" now in its third season, and the fantasy series ""The Witcher"" have also been popular binge watches.

The coronavirus pandemic has simply accelerated the existing trend toward video on demand and away from traditional pay TV, Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a report.

Netflix stock pulled back after its Q1 results, falling back to the top of its base before reversing higher in bullish fashion. NFLX stock dipped 0.2% to 435.55 on Friday, up nearly 5%. Shares are in a mini-consolidation above the prior base. It's not enough yet to form a proper pattern. But a move above the 449.52 peak could offer another entry into Netflix stock.

Apple Stock

Apple stock hit an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, just before the coronavirus stock market correction. AAPL stock has broken out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35 and is now slightly extended. Apple stock could dip back into the buy zone or form another handle to offer a new entry point, but hasn't shown signs of that yet.

Apple stock rose 2.1% to 310.13 on Friday, capping a 7.3% weekly gain. The RS line for AAPL stock is at a new high.

Apple stock is No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products group.

The consumer electronics company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results in April as demand for services and wearable devices rose. But iPhone revenue fell 6.7% as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones.

Analysts say the pandemic could also delay the release of the iPhone 12, Apple's first expected 5G phone, from its projected September launch to between October and early December.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock broke out of a cup base on April 14 with a buy point of 2,186.05. AMZN stock is currently extended above buy range. Shares rose 0.5% to 2,379.61 on Friday, climbing 4.1% for the week after rebounding from their 21-day line. AMZN stock could offer a new entry if its clears its record high of 2,475. Like Netflix stock, Amazon's short consolidation is far too short to be a proper pattern.

On May 1, Amazon stock tumbled nearly 8% following earnings, after hitting a record high heading into results. Q1 revenue growth beat Wall Street expectations. But earnings fell short and profit guidance was light as the e-commerce giant spends $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, to keep customers and employees safe.

Orders are soaring as customers are forced to stay at home amid the Covid-19 crisis. Amazon said it recently completed previous plans to hire 100,000 workers and will hire an additional 75,000 workers to meet growing demand. Amazon Web Services also is seeing strong demand from the stay-at-home trend.

The coronavirus stock market rally has come a long way from March lows. The Nasdaq is not far from all-time highs, led by Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big techs.

ServiceNow stock and Microsoft stock are in buy zones now. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are setting up new entries, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are closing in on buy points.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value, but off their worst levels. S&P 500 futures sank 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.3%. In the coronavirus stock market rally, Dow Jones futures have been less volatile than during the market crash. But Dow futures can still show some notable swings.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 4.34 million. Covid-19 deaths are at least 292,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped 1.4 million, with deaths above 83,000. U.S. coronavirus cases in the past two days have hit their lowest levels in weeks. Coronavirus testing has increased substantially, with the share of positive tests falling. Much of the improvement in terms of new cases has come in the New York/New Jersey area.

Dr. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, cited concerns about reopening certain parts of the country. Los Angeles County extended its stay-at-home order by another three months. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials warned of business failures on a ""grand scale.""

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally pulled back, closing at session lows on some of those coronavirus shutdown headlines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.9% and the S&P 500 index 2.05%. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.1%, snapping a six-session win streak with an outside day, downside reversal.

Apple stock, a Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq component, retreated 1.1%, also breaking its six-day win streak. The relative strength line for Apple stock hit a record high.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) slid 2.6%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 2.35%. Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are big IGV holdings. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 2.75%, with Nvidia and AMD notable members

The coronavirus stock market rally arguably has been due for a pullback. But should it be a lot lower?

Stock Market Rally Disconnect From Economic Reality?

Many argue that there's a disconnect between the coronavirus stock market rally from the economic reality of a massive recession and joblessness. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and will shed millions more in May. Unemployment is expected to top 20% at a minimum. There are some positive signs while states and countries are starting to open up, but until there's a vaccine much of the economy will be in a lower gear or shut down entirely.

So is the coronavirus stock market rally divorced from reality? Let's take a closer look.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Winners

The big stock market rally winners during the coronavirus crisis aren't a surprise. Many are just outright coronavirus plays: Zoom Video (ZM), Moderna (MRNA), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Peloton Interactive (PTON), along with Netflix stock, Amazon stock and Shopify stock.

Meanwhile, AMD stock, Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock, Nvidia (NVDA), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and many others — especially software — are benefiting in various ways from the stay-at-home trend, helping people hold up or even thrive in the coronavirus crisis.

Further down, there are internet giants Facebook stock and Google stock as well as digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL). Facebook and Google are seeing strong demand from people stuck at home. PayPal is benefiting from people adopting digital payments. Facebook stock, Google stock and PayPal stock may do especially well in a world of continued social distancing but with a recovery in advertising and consumer spending.

Likewise, Apple stock and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) have broken out. Apple and Lululemon are upscale consumer discretionary companies. In the midst of a deep recession where people have been stuck at home, status-enhancing discretionary purchases would seem at risk. But, to be blunt, many people who buy Apple and Lululemon products haven't lost their well-paying jobs. If these consumers feel confident that the economy will improve, they're willing to spend today.

Also, some medicals are doing well, seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, such as Dexcom (DXCM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Finally, a few consumer products companies like Clorox (CLX) and General Mills (GIS) were plodding along before the coronavirus crisis but have seen demand spike for cleaning products, cereal and soup.

So there's a good argument for all of these stocks to be doing well. In other words, the leading stocks in the coronavirus market rally don't seem disconnected from their companies' reality.

Given the heft of Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Netflix stock, Amazon stock, Nvidia stock, AMD stock, Facebook stock, Google stock, PayPal stock, Shopify stock, ServiceNow stock, along with many other coronavirus market rally winners, it's easy to see why the Nasdaq composite is doing so well.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Losers

Meanwhile, plenty of ""real economy"" market sectors have been badly hit: travel, leisure, energy, manufacturing and many retailers and financials. Many of these sectors are shut down.

Most of these companies were struggling before the coronavirus with beaten-down stocks. The market cap on many of these stocks is fairly low. Macy's (M), the nation's largest department store chain, has a market cap of $1.55 billion. Contrast that to Microsoft stock, with a market cap of $1.38 trillion. So solid advances by megacap techs such as Microsoft, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock can offset much bigger losses by companies with lower valuations.

Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, with more ""real economy"" stocks than the Nasdaq, have made far less progress in the coronavirus stock market rally.

Keep in mind that the stock market is made up of major companies, with most ""small-cap stocks"" small relative to the giants, but still fairly substantial operations. The stock market is not a microcosm of the overall economy, with the millions of truly small businesses struggling to survive.

Yes, The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Is Surprising

All that being said, it is surprising to see the stock market rally so quickly toward highs, even setting aside the economy. The old saying is that markets fall on an elevator and rise on an escalator. But the current stock market rally has run up almost as fast as the market crash.

The fact that the U.S. economy is suffering a historic contraction amid a still active pandemic makes the pace of the stock market rally even more surprising.

Follow, Don't Fight The Stock Market

But you want to pay attention to what the stock market is doing right now. Don't try to impose your opinions on it. The stock market doesn't care what you or I think.

Perhaps the market will re-evaluate the economic and earnings outlook to the downside, via a grim economic report, big corporate warning or a spike in coronavirus cases.

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock market move sideways for several weeks or pull back, at least somewhat.

Then again, maybe the stock market rally will surge into new high ground and beyond.

No matter what happens, if you're following the coronavirus market rally via the major indexes and leading stocks, you'll be ready to move with the stock market trend. Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Top Stocks To Watch

Microsoft stock, AMD stock, ServiceNow stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is Apple stock, which is modestly extended. Meanwhile, Facebook stock, AMD stock and Apple stock are on SwingTrader.

NFLX stock, FB stock, AMD stock and NOW stock are all IBD 50 members, along with several other stock market rally winners cited above.

Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

ServiceNow Stock

ServiceNow stock fell 4.7% to 365.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading. NOW stock is still above the 363.05 cup-base buy point. A pullback toward the buy point is normal, especially with race-from-the-bottom cup patterns.

The relative strength line for ServiceNow stock is still near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ServiceNow stock can be bought now, or perhaps at 388.60, just above Monday's all-time high.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock fell 2.3% to 182.51. MSFT stock is in range from a 180.10 handle on a double-bottom base. The RS line for Microsoft stock is at record highs.

Microsoft stock has the largest valuation of any U.S.-listed company. It just edges out Apple stock, which is at $1.35 trillion. Amazon stock follows at $1.18 trillion and Google stock at $939 billion.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock sank 2% to 431.82. NFLX stock is extended from an April breakout, but has been consolidating for a few weeks. It's not long enough for a proper base, but 449.62 could serve as an entry point for Netflix stock. A stock market rally pause or pullback could offer more time for NFLX stock to form a traditional consolidation.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock sank 2.2% to 2,356.95. Like Netflix stock, AMZN stock has been consolidating for a few weeks, though the e-commerce and cloud-computing services giant popped to a record 1,475 on April 30 just before earnings. Amazon stock fell on the earnings miss and weak guidance, but has remained in its recent range. A move above the old high would offer an entry point for Amazon stock.

AMD Stock

AMD stock sank 3.55%. The chipmaker is working on a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. AMD stock recently lagged some other data-center chipmakers, such as Nvidia stock and Inphi (IPHI), but may be perking up again. AMD earnings per share surged 300% and 200% in the last two quarters.

Facebook Stock

Facebook stock dipped 1.4% to 210.10. FB stock is steadily moving toward a V-shape consolidation with a 224.30 buy point. The relative strength line for Facebook stock has ramped up sharply in the last few weeks. Facebook stock once again on Tuesday was a ""Blue Dot"" stock, signifying stocks in bases with RS lines at new highs. They are identified on MarketSmith charts with a blue-shaded dot at the end of their RS lines.

A coronavirus stock market rally pause could offer a chance for Facebook stock to build a handle.

Google Stock

Google stock fell 2% to 1,375.18. A cup base with a 1,530.84 buy point has formed for GOOGL stock. Google stock, like FANG peer Facebook's stock, is a Blue Dot special today.

How long will work-from-home last? Most Google and employees likely will not be going back to the office full time until 2021.

The tech industry’s two biggest internet companies have told employees to settle into home-office routines through the end of the year amid the COVID-19 crisis. Both Google and Facebook this week said they will let most employees work from home through the end of 2020, while they also set timelines for gradually reopening corporate offices.

Google will begin a phased reopening of offices in June, but with just 10%-15% of staffers allowed to be in any one location at the outset, Alphabet and Google chief Sundar Pichai wrote in a May 8 memo, as first reported by CNBC. Most employees will be required to stay home, potentially through the end of 2020, he said, “though there will be moments or occasions where you are able to come into the office.”

In addition, Google set Friday, May 22, as an official day off for employees to decompress, with Pichai expressing concerns over burnout. “Take the time to do whatever you need to do to prioritize your well-being,” the CEO wrote in the memo.

That came after Facebook on Thursday said it plans to start opening most of its offices on July 6 (the Monday after the July 4 holiday weekend in the U.S.) while also saying employees who can work remotely will have that option through the end of the year. Previously, it had told employees to expect to WFH at least through the end of May.

“Most Facebook employees are fortunate to be able to work productively from home, so we feel a responsibility to allow people who don’t have this flexibility to access shared public resources first,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post last month. “I hope this helps contain the spread of COVID-19 so we can keep our communities safe and get back up and running again soon.”

At Facebook, more than 95% of full-time employees are working from home, CFO Dave Wehner said on the company’s Q1 earnings call last week. He added that safety is “the No. 1 priority for those essential workers who need to come into our data centers and other facilities.”

Facebook ended the first quarter with more than 48,000 full-time workers, after 3,300 net new hires in the period (primarily in technical functions). Zuckerberg reiterated on the call that the company plans to hire at least 10,000 more staffers in product and engineering roles in 2020.

Meanwhile, last month Zuckerberg said Facebook has canceled all large, in-person events through June 2021.

About 77% of Americans who normally work in an office environment are working at home, according to a survey conducted April 17-22 by staffing firm Robert Half International. Of those, 60% said their work/life balance has improved without a commute and 79% want employers to let them work from home more frequently in the future. On returning to regular work routines, 59% said they will reconsider attending in-person business events and 56% agreed that they worry about “being in close proximity” to others in the office.

When and how will Hollywood return to work? Variety Streaming Room is launching “Rebooting the Entertainment Industry,” a new series presented by PwC and Ad Council. The first episode, “The Entertainment & Media Workforce,” on Tuesday, May 12, at 10 a.m. PT, will feature WarnerMedia CTO Jeremy Legg, Verizon Media CTO Rathi Murthy, and PwC Workforce of the Future principal Jean Lee.

Twitter Inc. will let employees work from home permanently even after health authorities allow workers to return to their offices when the danger of the Covid-19 outbreak recedes.

Chief Executive Office Jack Dorsey told employees San Francisco-based Twitter was unlikely to open its offices before September, but that even when the company does so, most employees can work from wherever they want, according to a blog to be posted Tuesday. Buzzfeed earlier reported the policy.

“If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,” Twitter said in the post. “If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it’s safe to return.”

The company has more than 35 offices worldwide, including in Paris, New York and Toronto.

“We’ve been very thoughtful in how we’ve approached this from the time we were one of the first companies to move to a work-from-home model,” Twitter said in a statement. “We’ll continue to be, and we’ll continue to put the safety of our people and communities first.”

The announcement follows directives from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. that their employees should expect to work from home for the rest of the year. The clarity will help employees make longer-term plans about where they decide to live and what office equipment they choose to purchase for their homes.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/11/5-reasons-the-market-is-rising-while-unemployment.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,AMZN,2020-05-11T00:00:00,"Last Friday, May 8, was an odd day in the markets. That morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed the April damage from the COVID-19-related lockdowns, and the numbers weren't pretty. The unemployment rate skyrocketed by 10.3 percentage points to 14.7%, as non-farm payrolls fell by a stunning 20.5 million during the month.

Yet the market rallied, with the S&P 500 rising 1.69%, the Nasdaq climbing 1.58%, and the Russell 2000 surging 3.64%. As of now, the S&P has already risen a shocking 33.7% off its March lows, though it still remains 13.7% below its February highs.

Given the staggering job losses, what's going on here? Well, there are a few reasons stocks have acted so well over the past six weeks. While these gains are by no means assured, it's important to note the reasons that the scary headlines and violent price movements of the past two months shouldn't deter you from your long-term investing plan.

Reason No. 1: Job losses: temporary or not?

While the headline job numbers were quite scary-looking, there was somewhat of a silver lining further down in the report. Of those laid off, most in the Fed survey actually think they will only be laid off temporarily. The key sentences: ""The number of unemployed persons who reported being on temporary layoff increased about tenfold to 18.1 million in April. The number of permanent job losers increased by 544,000 to 2.0 million.""

Having 544,000 ""permanent"" layoffs is a heck of a lot better than having 20.5 million, which could be one of the reasons the market decided to rise in spite of the headline numbers. And with many areas of the country beginning to relax their stay-at-home rules, investors may be under the impression that these job losses will soon be restored once that happens.

I think it may be optimistic that all of the job losses will be refilled, as there is still sure to be demand destruction in many areas of the economy related to travel and leisure. Still, the huge difference between permanent and temporary job losses means the headline numbers may not be quite as bad as feared.

Reason No. 2: The market and stock prices are forward-looking

Of course, things still aren't great for the broader economy, whether job losses are temporary or not. U.S. gross domestic product is estimated to have fallen 4.8% in the first quarter, on the way to much worse results in the second and third quarters, since the first quarter had only two weeks of the lockdown. In March, real disposable income fell 2% month over month and consumer spending fell an even bigger 6%. And these are just the March numbers, reflecting only two weeks of lockdowns. April is bound to be much worse.

That doesn't bode very well for corporate earnings this year. Yet it's also possible that all of this bad news was already anticipated by the market's fastest-ever 30%-plus plunge in March. After all, the value of any company is the present value of all future cash flows. Thus, if a company's earnings go to zero but then ""return to normal"" in a year or two, its intrinsic value may only fall by 10%-15% or so -- and even less if the company is a high-growth stock with low current profits and a very long runway in front of it.

Which brings me to the next topic.

Reason No. 3: Interest rates are at rock-bottom

Dictating the ""discounted value"" of future free cash flows is the discount rate investors use, which is related to interest rates. As part of the Federal Reserve's massive action to support the economy, it dropped the federal funds rate to zero, which acts as a benchmark for many -- though by no means all -- other interest rates in the economy. One benchmark ""risk-free rate"" many investors use is the 10-year Treasury note rate, which has seen its yield fall from 2.45% one year ago to just 0.68% today.

Lower interest rates have the dual effect of stimulating the economy, as well as lowering the ""hurdle rate"" many investors use in their investments. When investors across the spectrum demand a lower rates of return on assets, asset prices go up, at least on a relative basis. And stocks are nothing but financial assets.

For example, if a stock is expected to make $5 in earnings in perpetuity, an 8% hurdle rate would make that stock worth $62.50. However, if investors now use a 5% hurdle rate, that same income stream is now worth $100. Thus, the fact that Treasury yields pay next to nothing makes corporate earnings -- unspectacular as they're bound to be -- more attractive. And if certain stocks can maintain their earnings or even benefit from the stay-at-home economy, those coveted earnings streams could be worth even more post-crisis.

Reason No. 4: Massive government action

Besides interest rates, one shouldn't overlook the massive action the federal government and the Federal Reserve took in March and April. Congress passed the $2.3 trillion CARES Act in March, which provided stimulus payments to individuals, grants for businesses that retain their workers, and low-cost loans for many businesses across industries as well as municipalities heavily affected by COVID-19.

However, the Federal Reserve stimulated in an even bigger way, buying all sorts of credit products, including Treasuries, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, collateralized loan obligations (auto, credit card, and student loans), corporate bonds, then even some high-yield bond exchange-traded funds as the crisis worsened. The massive buying spree from the Federal Reserve could total more than $6 billion injected into the ailing economy, trouncing the impact of the CARES Act.

By declaring itself a buyer of last resort, the Fed managed to put a floor under the credit markets, which allowed many corporations to raise liquidity during April to get them through the crisis.

In addition, the massive and speedy action sent a signal to the markets that the government is prepared to do ""whatever it takes"" to stimulate the economy and prevent the very worst outcomes. That jolt of confidence also probably had an effect on the stock market in April.

Reason No. 5: Remember what the index is made of

In spite of these government actions, many companies and industries remain in very dire straits. Yet for those looking at the rise of the S&P 500 index and still scratching their heads, you should note that the five biggest tech companies are now making up a larger and larger part of that index. In fact, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) combined to make up over 20% of the S&P 500 as of the end of April.

These technology companies all have some of the best balance sheets, business models, and growth profiles in the entire world, even despite COVID-19. And since the S&P 500 is a market cap-weighted index, as those companies bounce back, they make up more and more of that index, versus other troubled areas of the market such as airlines or oil and gas, which make up less and less of the index as their values go down. And remember, some of the worst-hit areas of the economy are neighborhood small businesses, which aren't in the index at all.

Thus, the index will average out the winners and the losers, with the more resilient companies becoming more heavily weighted over time. That's also helping the index bounce back as the reshuffling between the haves and have-nots of the stay-at-home economy continues.

Conclusion: Is the market right?

While many have been shocked by the snap-back of the markets since the March lows, remember that the initial plunge was very deep and fast. Given the five reasons cited here, it perhaps shouldn't be surprising that the market has been bouncing back amid low interest rates, federal stimulus, and optimism that the economic shutdown is temporary.

However, that doesn't mean there still can't be another leg lower. After all, some of those temporary job losses could turn permanent if certain industries stay closed for longer. A lot of this will depend on how the economy contains the virus, and how quickly biotech companies can develop a vaccine. Right now, new treatment candidates are emerging every day, which is spurring optimism. If containment and treatment are accomplished somewhat quickly, the market could continue to go up.

However, if vaccine or treatment trials prove disappointing and second or third waves of the virus hit the economy, job losses could continue and GDP could continue to decline, in which case the market could follow these figures down. As Warren Buffett said in his annual meeting, the range of outcomes is extremely wide.

So what should you do at this moment? Continue with the investing plan you've set out for yourself and your risk tolerance. Usually, this entails consistently investing in the market each month, once you've set up an emergency fund and paid down your high-interest debt. With the market acting like a manic-depressive for the past two months, with a shocking decline and perhaps an even more surprising bounce-back, sticking with your investing plan and taking the emotions out of your strategy is more important than ever."

A few months ago we asked the question whether Ken Fisher is a ""legendary investor or a marketing genius"". One thing is certain that Ken Fisher isn't an investor who tries to time the market. As the stocks fell all over the world during the first quarter, Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio also fell from $99 billion to $80 billion. We assume that most of this decline was due to the losses in stock prices rather than investor redemptions.

Wall Street analysts and investors don't respect Ken Fisher much. We have never heard of Ken Fisher's stock pitches move stocks the way Bill Ackman or David Tepper moves the markets. Nevertheless Ken Fisher has been able to deliver decent returns to grow his fund's AUM to nearly $100 billion. That's nothing to sneeze at.

[caption id=""attachment_26357"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""359""] Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management[/caption]

FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT More

In this article we are going to take a look at Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks. During the first quarter Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks delivered an average loss of only 6%, vs. a loss of nearly 20% for the S&P 500 Index. That return was even better than the average return of top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of 6.9% during the first quarter. As you can guess top hedge fund stock picks is a very fertile area to look for good stocks to beat the market.

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years.

Keeping this in mind, let's now take a look at Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks at the end of March.

The fifth largest position in billionaire Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio was Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Ken Fisher had nearly $2.6 billion invested in the Chinese giant. Alibaba Group Holding was also the fourth most popular stock among all hedge funds at the end of December. We believe Alibaba shares can reach $400 over the next 3-5 years.

The fourth largest position in Fisher's portfolio was Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Fisher had nearly $3.2 billion invested in Amazon.com Inc shares at the end of March. Amazon shares delivered total gains of 22% since then, potentially giving Fisher total gains of more than $650 million. Legendary investor Bill Miller doesn't think Amazon.com is a good stock to be invested in after its strong 2020 gains. In the following video you can watch why Bill Miller thinks it doesn’t make sense today to invest in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and 6 other recession stocks that performed well so far this year.

Bill Miller's hedge fund returned 120% in 2019. So, investors shouldn't hastily dismiss his point.

The third biggest position in Ken Fisher's portfolio at the end of March was Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), valued at $3.3 billion. Visa Inc. was the worst performing top 5 stock in Ken Fisher's portfolio in Q1, losing 14.1%. However, Visa shares recovered most of their Q1 losses so far in the second quarter. Visa has been a hedge fund favorite for a long time but it really never got too cheap for us to recommend it to our subscribers.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the second biggest position in Fisher's 13F portfolio. Fisher had $3.4 billion invested in Microsoft Corporation at the end of March and those shares are worth 17% more today. Microsoft Corporation is one of the most valuable companies in the world today, so it isn't a surprise for us to see this stock near the top of Fisher's portfolio.

The coronavirus crisis has played to the strengths of tech companies: People are staying indoors, increasingly using the internet and streaming more video than ever.

It’s clear that the tech giants are well positioned to make it through the crisis relatively intact. “Alphabet [Google’s parent], and Amazon will be just fine,” says Tal Chalozin, co-founder and chief technical officer of ad-tech company Innovid.

The crisis stands to make the most powerful tech companies even stronger, as they have business models built for digital marketplaces and the cash reserves to withstand an economic downturn, Chalozin says, adding, “It definitely is going to make the bigger players bigger.”

That’s not to say a recession precipitated by COVID-19 will be good for any business. Double-digit unemployment in the U.S. will weigh on consumer spending (and by extension advertising) across the board.

And Big Tech isn’t immune from the fallout. In reporting first-quarter 2020 earnings, Google and Facebook saw ad spending fall off a cliff in March, but both companies said that the numbers stabilized going into April. Apple’s hardware sales for the first three months of 2020 were down — but the services business, which includes App Store sales, surged to an all-time high of $13.3 billion for the period, up 17%.

Amazon sales boomed in the first quarter to an eye-popping $75.4 billion, up 26% year over year, on overwhelming demand from stay-at-home customers. At the same time, the crisis is taking a big toll on the bottom line. CEO Jeff Bezos said Amazon will spend roughly its first-quarter operating profit of $4 billion — or more — on costs related to COVID-19 in the second quarter.

“The current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon’s business as never before,” Bezos said in prepared remarks addressing the first-quarter results, “but it’s also the hardest time we’ve ever faced.”

Whereas companies in Hollywood and other industry sectors are slashing staff or furloughing employees, tech players say they are still hiring through 2020, though at a slower pace than previously projected. “With our strong financial position and the important social value our services provide, we’re planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year,” Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told analysts last week.

The ad businesses of Facebook, Google and Amazon will definitely weather the storm — and not all of their competitors will, says Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at market research firm eMarketer. The pullback will only get worse in the near term, she predicts. For example, video ad spending could decline as much as 21% year over year in the second quarter, according to her forecasts. That could mean more M&A in the sector. “Overall, it points to probably more consolidation in the digital ad market later this year or into 2021,” she says.

Meanwhile, digital entertainment is getting a massive adrenaline shot because of the health crisis, with virtually all theaters shut down nationwide. Netflix reeled in a record 15.7 million subscribers in the first quarter, though execs believe the torrid pace won’t continue through the rest of 2020. On another front, Universal’s direct-to-streaming “Trolls World Tour” in its first three weeks of release pulled in almost $100 million — a record for a digital-only movie — and those transactions went through platforms owned by Apple, Amazon, Google and NBCUniversal’s Fandango along with those of pay-TV operators.

“At this moment in time, Netflix and large streaming services are much better positioned than film production companies,” says Michelle Wroan, KPMG’s media industry leader in the U.S. “The eyeballs are in the home.”

It remains to be seen in the post-COVID-19 reality who the winners and losers will be. Wroan believes theaters and live events will rebound eventually. “Humans are social beings,” she says. “There’s pent-up demand to be social” — by which she means in real life, not on Facebook.

On the other hand, the pandemic is training consumers to satisfy their entertainment diets without setting foot outside the house. That bodes well for traditional media companies that have shifted to direct-to-streaming models, and not a moment too soon amid life in quarantine. Disney already has a hit in Disney Plus, and WarnerMedia hopes HBO Max will make a splash later this month.

The social media giant also expects most offices to stay closed until July 6, according to a company spokesperson.

The virus, which has infected more than 3.8 million people globally so far, has forced strict lockdowns in most countries and changed the way businesses function, with work from home emerging as the new norm.

In a bid to give its growing roster of small-screen content a big-screen outlet, retail and more recently Hollywood content giant Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report reportedly has held talks to take over financially troubled AMC Entertainment (AMC) - Get Report.

Shares of AMC surged more than 26% on Monday after the U.K.’s Daily Mail newspaper reported that Amazon has held talks with the world’s largest cinema-chain owner, which runs movie theaters globally under the AMC and Odeon names in the U.K., the U.S. and Canada, among other locations.

The two companies reportedly have held talks about a potential takeover of AMC by Amazon. However, it is not clear if the discussions are still active or if they will lead to a deal, sources told the Mail.

An agreement, if it were to be consummated, would effectively give Amazon and specifically its growing Amazon Prime movies and entertainment service an outlet to stream content to mass audiences outside of their respective living rooms.

Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) - Get Report have turned the film industry on its proverbial head by offering subscriptions to watch original films and television shows both at home and on the go, completely bypassing the golden rule of releasing content on the “big screen” first.

With the coronavirus pandemic shuttering theaters and with more people streaming content directly, AMC and other theater chains have found themselves in an even darker corner financially as they fight for their decades-old first-rights position to show content first.

AMC earlier this month came out swinging at Comcast (CMCSA) - Get Report-owned Universal Pictures after Universal opted to bypass theaters and release its “Trolls: World Tour” animated movie directly to consumers amid the pandemic and global lockdown, with the chain effectively banning Universal from showing any of its releases in AMC-owned theaters.

Amazon became the first streaming service to win a coveted Oscar in 2017 for its movie 'Manchester By The Sea,' starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams.

When asked about the reports during his daily interviews with StreetLightning, Jim Cramer called Amazon's interest a possibility. Watch his full take here.

Shares of AMC were up 26.34% at $5.18 in trading on Monday. Shares of Amazon ended the trading day Friday up 0.51% at $2,379.61."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-why-amazon-could-160846284.html,AMZN,2020-05-08T16:08:46+00:00,"The definition of value

In my opinion, one of the reasons why value has underperformed growth in recent years is that the definition of value has changed from what it used to be.

Value has become a byword for buying cheap stocks. Just because a stock looks cheap does not necessarily mean that it is, and nowadays moreso than in the past, these businesses are struggling to grow and are thus cheap because they deserve to be.





On the other hand, companies dropped into the ""growth"" bucket tend to look expensive at first compared to old valuation metrics, but these businesses have much more predictable and growing cash flow streams. If you can buy these companies at a discount to your estimate of intrinsic value, that that would qualify as value investing.

Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) talked about this very same topic at the 2019 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting of shareholders, when one investor asked the Oracle of Omaha about the group's position in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Amazon as a value stock

Amazon appeared in Berkshire's portfolio in the first quarter of 2019. The position, which is around $1 billion in value, is relatively small (it's just 0.4% of the equity portfolio today), but it still attracted plenty of attention.

Buffett has since said that it was one of Berkshire's portfolio managers that initiated this position, so he's been unable to give a full explanation as to why it was acquired. However, at the 2019 annual meeting, he was asked if this acquisition meant that Berkshire was no longer focused on value investing.

Here's how Buffett replied:



""Yeah. It's interesting that the term ""value investing"" came up. Because I can assure you that both managers who -- and one of them bought some Amazon stock in the last quarter, which will get reported in another week or ten days -- he is a value investor. The idea that value is somehow connected to book value or low price/earnings ratios or anything -- as Charlie has said, all investing is value investing. I mean, you're putting out some money now to get more later on. And you're making a calculation as to the probabilities of getting that money and when you'll get it and what interest rates will be in between.""







This calculation applies to any business, Buffett continued, whether you're buying a stock at 70% of book value or Amazon at ""some very high multiple of reported earnings.""

There are many ways to value a security, but as Buffett explained last year, the most important thing investors need to consider is how much cash the business will produce between now and ""judgment day."" If you can estimate this figure with a reasonably high level of confidence, you can place a value on the security. If you can buy at a discount to that value, then that is value investing:



""In the end, it all goes back to Aesop... a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush... And when we buy Amazon, we try and figure out... whether there's three or four or five in the bush and how long it'll take to get to the bush, how certain he is that he's going to get to the bush, you know, and then who else is going to come and try and take the bush away...the basic equation is that of Aesop. And your success in investing depends on how well you were able to figure out how certain that bush is, how far away it is, and what the worst case is, instead of two birds being there, and only one being there, and the possibilities of four or five or ten or 20 being there.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-richest-man-courts-saudis-063625411.html,FB,2020-05-11T06:36:25+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- The Saudi sovereign wealth fund and General Atlantic are among firms exploring investments in billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s digital business, as Asia’s richest man seeks to expand his operations outside oil and petrochemicals, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion Public Investment Fund is considering buying a minority stake in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jio Platforms unit, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.

General Atlantic, the U.S. investment firm that helped fund Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., is discussing a potential investment of about $850 million to $950 million in Jio Platforms, the people said. The deal could be completed as soon as this month, though no agreement has been finalized and plans may change, the people said.

Any new investment into Jio Platforms will add to the $8 billion deal run that Ambani has sealed in recent weeks. Facebook Inc. in April agreed to pay $5.7 billion for a 10% stake in the digital unit, while Silver Lake Partners and Vista Equity Partners last week said they would invest about $2.25 billion in total.

Investors are betting on Jio’s access to India’s huge consumer market, and its potential to shake up traditional industries in the country -- from retail to education and payments -- with its technology. India is the only major open Internet market where foreign technology giants such as Amazon.com.Inc., Walmart Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. can compete for market share.

The string of investments from technology giants and private equity firms will go toward slashing debt at Reliance Industries, which is controlled by Ambani. The outside money also helps set a valuation for Jio, which until recently has been largely owned by the billionaire’s conglomerate.

Representatives for Reliance Industries and Saudi’s Public Investment Fund didn’t respond to requests for comment, while General Atlantic declined to comment.

Shares of Reliance Industries rose as much as 3.4% and touched their highest level since Dec. 20 on Monday in Mumbai.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fear-stemming-dividend-cuts-overblown-124912104.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T12:49:12+00:00,"Coronavirus-induced economic mayhem has flared up investors’ concerns about companies’ ability to maximize shareholder value going forward. The fears do have reasons. There have been rampant cuts in share repurchases, one of the popular tools to have charged up Wall Street time and again for all these years.

Even promised dividends have not been safe lately. Liquidity crisis at corporations called for prudent cash management and led to such a step. Per the S&P Dow Jones Indices, March 2020 dividend announcements were negative. There were 13 cuts, with 10 being suspensions, making for a total forward impact of $13.9 billion. Last time it turned negative was in second-quarter 2009.

As of May 4, about 25% in the S&P 500 had suspended guidance for future quarters, with at least 30 cutting or pausing dividend payouts in order to fight the economic-fallout caused by the novel coronavirus.

All Is Not Lost

Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley indicated that bullishness has been noticed in the dividend futures market, which reflects investor views about future dividend payments by the S&P 500 companies.

Per Morgan Stanley, prices in the dividend futures market have shown better correlation with stock prices than actual earnings forecasts. Dividend futures market currently shows the market expecting company dividends to fall 15% this year versus a 23% decline during the Great Financial Crisis.

Most dividend hikes came from the financial sector in recent times. Of the 19 companies to hike dividends in the second quarter, six belonged to the financial sector. Nineteen S&P 500 companies increased their dividends during April.

Morgan Stanley believes that implied 15% haircut in S&P 500 dividends “may overstate the likely dividend cuts this year.” “Dividend futures have already bottomed and rebounded sharply, which is in sharp contrast to the [the next 12 months’] EPS forecasts,” according to the note.

Which Dividend Stock to Bet On?

Overall, the S&P 500 investors should expect a 4% to 5% cut in dividends this year, per a S&P Dow Jones Indices’ strategist. So, it is better not to fall for the yield trap as high returns are always involved with high risks. It is better to go for quality picks or for those stocks that have strong financials which can continue to support dividend payments over the long term. Dividend growth stocks are good bets in this regard.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few stocks that have announced or raised dividends amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apple AAPL – Dividend Yield 0.99%

iPhone maker hiked dividends by 6.49% to $0.82 on Apr 30.

Johnson& Johnson JNJ – Dividend Yield 2.56%

The pharma giant hiked dividends by 6% to $1.01 on Apr 14.

Costco COST – Dividend Yield 0.92%

On Apr 15, the seller of high volumes of foods and general merchandise (including household products and appliances) raised 7.69% to $0.70 per share.

Procter & Gamble PG – Dividend Yield 2.73%

The consumer products company raised its dividends by 6% to $0.7907 per share on Apr 14.

Newmont Corporation NEM – Dividend Yield 0.87%

One of the world's largest producers of gold with several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia and Ghana declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 a share, in line with its January announcement that talked about boosting its dividend to about $1 a share annually.

(AMZN) missed earnings per share (EPS) estimates when it reported results after the closing bell on April 30. The stock set its all-time intraday high of $2,475.00 at the close on April 30 but declined to $2,256.38 on May 4, staying above its monthly value level at $2,212.91. I do not show a risky level at this time.

The online retail giant has missed EPS estimates in three out of the past four quarters. CEO Jeff Bezos indicated that Amazon's stream of revenue will be used for upgrades to the company's massive infrastructure and platforms. The stock is not cheap, as its P/E ratio is elevated at 113.12 without offering a dividend, according to Macrotrends.

Amazon stock closed last week at $2,379.81, up 28.8% year to date and in bull market territory at 46.3% above its March 16 low of $1,626.03. The stock is just 3.9% below its April 30 high of $2,475.00. Amazon had been trading around its 200-day simple moving average until March 23. Before breaking out above this average, now at $1,894.83, the stock stabilized around its annual value level at $1,777.70. This was a magnet between March 9 and March 19.

The daily chart for Amazon

Refinitiv XENITH

The daily chart for Amazon shows that the stock has moved sideways over the past 52 weeks, tracking its 200-day simple moving average now at $1,895.83. The stock gapped higher on Jan. 31 on a positive reaction to earnings reported after the close on Jan. 30. This set the stage for a quick spike to a high of $2,185.95 set on Feb. 11.

The stock gapped below its semiannual pivot at $2,078.34 on Feb. 24 and then fell below the 200-day simple moving average at $1,851.43 on March 11. After trading as low as $1,626.03 on March 16, the stock regained key levels to the upside.

Amazon stock crossed above its annual pivot at 1,777.70 on March 18 and then moved above its 200-day simple moving average on March 23. The semiannual pivot at $2,078.34 was crossed on April 13. The quarterly pivot at $2,188.74 was crossed to the upside on April 14. The stock is now above its monthly value level for May at $2,212.91.

The weekly chart for Amazon

Refinitiv XENITH

The weekly chart for Amazon is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $1,184.64. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or reversion to the mean, at $1,431.80, which has not been tested over the past five years.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week rising to 77.78, up from 73.26 on May 1. The stock will soon become overbought with a reading above 80.00.

Trading strategy: Buy Amazon shares on weakness to the monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual value levels at $2,212.91, $2,188.74, 2,078.34, and $1,777.70, respectively.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.

The second quarter 2020 level was established based upon the March 31 close, and the monthly level for May was established based upon the April 30 close. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week, and new quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year, while annual levels remain in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered ""too cheap to ignore,"" which is typically followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-add-labels-misleading-covid-173618492.html,FB,2020-05-11T17:36:18+00:00,"(Bloomberg) --

Twitter Inc. will now label some misinformation related to Covid-19 that it deems confusing or misleading, increasing the likelihood that more tweets will be marked or taken down.

Twitter previously announced that it would remove coronavirus information posing a direct threat to user safety. The new label will apply to tweets that are “less severe,” but “where people may still be confused or misled,” the company said Monday in a blog post. The tweets may be given a label that says, “some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflicts with guidance from public health experts regarding Covid-19.” Users will have an option to click for more information.

Twitter, like Facebook Inc., has been trying to curb the spread of incorrect data and misleading material about the virus. Both companies are relying on public health authorities to determine when content may be misleading -- a strategy meant to help them avoid making decisions about what medical advice may be true or false.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-needs-movies-more-multiplex-164849318.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T16:48:49+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As Amazon.com Inc. approaches the third anniversary of its Whole Foods Market acquisition, there’s speculation that the tech giant could set its sights on AMC Entertainment Inc. for its next oddball deal. But modernizing an already popular supermarket and luring shoppers with discounts on avocados isn’t the same as running a movie-theater chain — that would amount to a rescue mission. If Jeff Bezos wants to deepen his Hollywood ties, why not buy a studio instead?

Amazon is said to have studied a deal for AMC and the two sides may have held talks, according to a May 9 report in the British newspaper the Daily Mail citing unnamed sources. Deadline later contradicted the story, saying there aren’t any discussions. This may turn out to be a case in which investor hope, rather than deal logic, was informing a rumor. AMC is the largest cinema operator in the U.S. and Europe, where it owns the Odeon & UCI circuit. That purchase, along with the takeover of its U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas and a costly theater renovation streak, has left AMC with a large debt burden that now threatens to topple the company as most of its cinemas remain closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The dwindling box office isn’t just a temporary quarantine-related problem. A nearly doubling in the price of movie tickets over the last two decades has masked an otherwise gradual decline in patronage. After regional stay-at-home orders lift, prolonged virus fears and a continued shift toward at-home video streaming will take even more of a toll. Studios are beginning to experiment with on-demand releases that are either concurrent with theatrical debuts or skip movie houses entirely, as Universal Studios chose to do with its “Trolls World Tour” premiere last month. Though AMC does sell its own on-demand movie access through the new Theatres On Demand platform, Amazon Prime Video is already a more established destination.

What Amazon would be buying is a heap of debt and empty auditoriums. And what in the world is Bezos going to do with 11,000 exhibition screens? If the future of entertainment is streaming content, then a company like AMC Networks — the channel known for “Breaking Bad” and “The Walking Dead” — is a much more fitting candidate than AMC theaters. But even AMC Networks, which is valued at just $1.3 billion, may still be too niche for Amazon’s needs.

If Bezos truly wants to dominate in streaming entertainment, he should think about acquiring a Hollywood studio. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., ViacomCBS Inc.’s Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. are all options and may be willing sellers. They could help provide the must-see content that Amazon needs more of to drive interest in its Prime Video service. As of now, the “free” movies and shows available to Prime members are more of an extra feature that’s nice to have, but easily forgotten about. In fact, more than three-quarters of Amazon Prime Video members still use Netflix, according to research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. The same argument can be made for Apple Inc. as it invests in the Apple TV+ service, as I wrote last year.

Before June 2017, no one could have predicted that Bezos, a tech mogul, would scoop up the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.6 billion and that it would be his largest takeover ever. Even now, the affiliation with Amazon hasn’t done much to change the Whole Foods shopping experience. It’s possible that Bezos sees some hidden value in cinemas, but the connection is even less clear than it is with supermarkets. What’s more likely is that Bezos is thinking about the future, where more is done remotely on our devices — especially TV viewing. In that case, Bezos doesn’t need a whole bunch of reclining seats, he needs eyeballs and something to show them.

By Jack Stubbs and Katie Paul

LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Iran's state broadcaster has used hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging online since at least 2011, targeting voters in countries including Britain and the United States, Facebook said on Tuesday.

In a monthly report of accounts suspended for so-called ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"", Facebook said it had removed eight networks in recent weeks, including one with links to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Corporation (IRIB).

The company also removed a U.S. network of fake accounts linked to QAnon, a fringe group that claims Democrats are behind international crime rings, and a separate U.S.-based campaign with ties to white supremacist websites VDARE and the Unz Review.

Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said both U.S. networks recently began pushing coronavirus-related disinformation, taking advantage of a surge in online interest in the pandemic to promote anti-Semitic and anti-Asian hate speech tied to it.

""We've seen people behind these campaigns opportunistically leverage coronavirus-related topics to build an audience and drive people to their pages or off-platform sites,"" he said.

The networks also pushed content focused on the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the report said.

Gleicher said the IRIB network had ""substantial connections"" to previously identified Iranian disinformation campaigns, but it was too early say whether it was directly responsible for those operations.

The state-owned IRIB, which has its head appointed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iranian officials have previously dismissed allegations of running coordinated disinformation campaigns as ""ridiculous"".

The Islamic Republic has emerged as one of the most persistent players in online influence operations, as Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet's Google have had to grapple with state-backed groups using social media to further their geopolitical agendas and spread disinformation.

A Reuters investigation in 2018 found that one Tehran-based operation had used more than 70 websites masquerading as local news outlets to covertly disseminate Iranian state propaganda in more than 15 countries, at one point tricking the then Pakistani defence minister into issuing a nuclear threat against Israel.

Iranian officials in Tehran and London did not reply to questions about the operation at the time.

Gleicher said the newly identified network had used similar tactics, including posing as independent media websites and charitable organisations, to target countries from Algeria and Bangladesh to the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe.

The network used more than 500 accounts on Facebook and its photo-sharing site, Instagram, to spread messages that often focused on local conflicts or criticism of U.S. actions in the region, he said. ""In general, these were narratives that are aligned with Iranian geopolitical interests.""

Researchers at social media analytics firm Graphika, who reviewed the IRIB-linked accounts before they were suspended by Facebook, said some of the earliest-identified activity dated back to 2012 and targeted the U.S. Republican party primaries.

Two years later, other accounts in the network used a handful of fake personas, memes and cartoons to support Scotland's referendum bid to break away from the United Kingdom, they said.

Graphika's head of investigations, Ben Nimmo, said those attempts were short-lived but show that Iran was experimenting with online election meddling years before alleged Russian attempts to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations.

""The Iranian experiment was relatively tiny and didn't last long or have any noticeable impact. What's interesting is how early they started,"" he said.

""This whole takedown underlines how persistent the Iranian state is when it comes to covert influence operations.""

With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I start, I'd like to recognize that although today's call will focus on the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, this is a human health crisis with severe impact to families and individuals around the world. We are all experiencing dramatic changes to our daily lives and regular routines. Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities where we live and work. I'd like to sincerely thank my Sabre teammates who have made great sacrifices in this incredibly challenging environment. Our Sabre offices around the globe have been closed for a number of weeks now as we practice social distancing. Before Doug takes you through our financial results, I'll begin by discussing the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the global travel industry and provide detail on the decline in bookings and travel trends since its outbreak. Next, I will describe the actions we have taken in response to this challenge. Then I will describe the impact these actions will have on our technology investments. Finally, I'll share why we believe Sabre is resilient and well positioned for a post-crisis environment. The COVID-19 pandemic, as we all know, is an unprecedented challenge facing the entire travel industry. Since its initial onset in late 2019, the outbreak has caused a sharp decline in industry bookings.

As we exited the quarter in March, effectively 0 new bookings and the impact of cancellations resulted in a negative bookings environment on a net basis. Total GDS industry air bookings declined by 10% and 25% and 113% in January, February and March on a net basis, with the industry down 49% for the first quarter of 2020. All regions were impacted on a similar level. This is what was reported by the total global GDS industry and factors in no exclusions. Sabre's new air bookings declined by 8%, 17% and 70% in January, February and March, respectively. On a net basis, including the impact of cancellations, Sabre's air bookings declined by 9%, 23% and 111% for the same months. Based on the weekly industry trends we've been monitoring since COVID-19's outbreak, it appears the decline in net air bookings peaked in late March across all regions. Data through April suggest the industry bookings decline was still exacerbated by cancellations. Drilling into daily trends. Cancellation activity peaked toward late March as COVID-19 restrictions went into place around the globe. This was concurrent with the very sharp decline in new bookings made. Since late March, Sabre's new air bookings have declined to less than 100,000 daily or down by more than 90% versus a pre-crisis 2019 average of roughly 1.5 million daily bookings. As of mid-April, we believe we have seen a normalization in cancellation rates. We believe we have flushed out most of the cancellation activity with respect to previously made bookings.

Although new bookings remain severely depressed, net booking activity improved in April versus the end of March. In the first quarter of 2020, declines in passengers boarded and new hotel central reservation system transactions did not happen as fast as the decline in new air bookings. However, the declines in all three of our metrics, Travel Network air bookings, Airline Solutions passengers boarded and hospitalities Hospitality Solutions CRS transactions converged at the high 90s toward the end of March and remained at this level through April. The future impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, and the travel environment remains highly uncertain. Air carriers announced second quarter capacity plans indicate continued declines across all regions. Based on data from OAG, global capacity in April declined approximately 70% year-over-year. Looking to May. North America total scheduled capacity is currently down over 75% with American, United and Delta down 75% to over 80%. EMEA is down 75% with Lufthansa, IAG and Air France KLM all down over 90%. Latin America is down over 80% with Avianca, GOL and LATAM all down over 90%. And in Asia Pacific, Air Asia, Cathay Pacific and Qantas are all down over 90%.The numbers I just reported are scheduled capacity levels. Operated capacity is even lower than marketing schedules filed.

We expect significant schedule reductions in June and beyond. It is important to note that many airlines around the world are still selling a marketing schedule that isn't too different from last year. But the closer we get to the actual travel period, we see marketing and operating schedules being reduced. This strategy allows airlines to sell and consolidate into fewer flights. Because we are a mission-critical technology provider to the travel industry, our top priority is to be there for our customers both now and when the business environment improves. Given the current uncertainty in the travel environment, our current focus is on long-term liquidity. We have and will continue to take actions to align our cost structure to demand both near term and in 2021. Importantly, our cash position and aggressive, but thoughtful management of the business, affords us the flexibility to continue advancing technology capabilities to meet demands. Let me summarize the cost actions we have taken to date. In early Q1, our immediate response to COVID-19 was the implementation of a hiring freeze, elimination of pay increases, restriction of employee travel and reduction in consulting spend. As the impact of the virus continued to spread globally and bookings fell dramatically in mid- to late March, we announced cost savings and initiatives expected to result in $200 million savings in 2020.

This includes pay reductions for U.S. salaried employees, suspension of the 401(k) match, voluntary retirement, voluntary separations and various pay reductions around the globe. I am very grateful and proud of my colleagues around the world who have participated in these programs. In mid-April, we announced plans to reduce 2020 costs by an additional $125 million, including the very difficult decision to furlough 1/3 of our global workforce. To my teammates around the world currently on furlough, I understand how difficult this is for you and your families. We will continue to work with rigor and resiliency to ensure we are an even stronger company in the future. Because 2/3 of our cost structure is variable, it provides protection. It also provides the ability to take further actions, although we hope they will not be needed. Next, let me summarize the actions we have taken to enhance our liquidity position. In mid-March, we suspended our dividend and share repurchases effective after the March 30, 2020, payment. We also drew down on a revolver of $375 million. On April 17, we raised $1.1 billion of incremental capital through upsized senior secured and exchangeable notes offerings.

Doug will share more detail, but with $1.1 billion capital raise, $325 million cost-savings initiatives and other actions, we believe our current liquidity is sufficient for more than one and half years even in a 0-booking, no-travel scenario. In addition, effective May 1, 2020, Sabre and Farelogix agreed to terminate the Farelogix acquisition agreement. One question we are often asked is how the cost reductions we are making impact the business, including our previously announced incremental technology investments. Let me walk you through some of what we will and won't change as a result of our cost-savings initiatives. To be clear, we are still proceeding with our technology transformation and transition to Google Cloud. Our technology transformation is expected to lower cost, accelerate innovation and provide competitive differentiation. We continued to expect approximately $100 million in annual cost savings by 2024, when we expect the technology transformation to be largely completed. Our partnership with Google is off to a great start, and I couldn't be happier with the collaboration so far. We are already executing on the innovation framework we have in place with Google.

Today, I am pleased to announce we have entered into a new commercial agreement for Sabre to provide availability data APIs for consumption by Google's flight search products. We are delaying our billing systems upgrade and our full-service property management system in participation with Accor, primarily due to Accor's furlough of 75% of their workforce. We continue to advance NDC-related projects with our current set of actively engaged airline, agency and corporate partners. We have made progress and reached important milestones over the last several months. However, certain incremental investments in NDC have been slowed down as many of our customers redirect their focus on financial and operational priorities. Each one of these projects is important to Sabre's future, and we expect to return to them after we have a better insight on industrywide recovery. To state the obvious, we do not know when travel demand will recover or what the travel industry will look like on the other side of this crisis. We are fortunate that we have access to global data in a realtime and are monitoring the significant insight this gives us for early indications of improvements throughout the world. Previous industry downturns suggest travel demand is unlikely to return to 2019 levels for at least several years.

Customers need to feel comfortable in restaurants, on trains and airports and on planes. The timing for this level of comfort in crowded places may vary around the world. We are hoping for the best, but as I have described, planning for the worst. We suspect leisure travel will return more quickly than corporate travel as companies carefully consider their duty of care to employees and as leisure travelers are tempted by lower fares and room rates. Travelers may stay closer to their home market where they better understand the health of risk. The North American market may remain the most stable given its relative precrisis strength, but even North American carriers are retrenching significantly. Ultimately, we expect a smaller travel market for some time and are positioning Sabre for this new reality. We are confident the strength of our liquidity position, flexible cost structure, long-standing customer relationships and experienced management team will allow Sabre to endure this period for period of prolonged uncertainty.

And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Doug.

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Sean, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge this is a difficult time. Our thoughts are with those around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are in a time of unprecedented disruption to the travel industry. As Sean mentioned, the latest IATA projection is a 55% reduction in passenger revenue in 2020. Approximately 15% of our revenue is not tied to travel volumes, which partially mitigates exposure we have to COVID-19's impact on travel. However, our first quarter results were significantly impacted by the pandemic. In the first quarter, revenue was down 37%. Travel Network bookings were down 45%. Remember, we report bookings on a net basis, which means net of cancellations. In the quarter, new air bookings were down 32%. But there was significant cancellation activity as COVID-19 restrictions were put in place. As of quarter end, we have recognized $105 million of revenue from bookings not yet departed and have a cancellation reserve of $44 million on our balance sheet. We believe we had peaked cancellation rates at the end of March and have flushed through most of the initial incremental COVID-19 cancellation activity as of mid-April. Remember that about half of our cancellation risk is offset by reductions in incentive payments. First quarter EBITDA was positive. It was down significantly year-over-year.

Our cost-savings initiatives were not announced until mid-March, so we expect most of the savings will be recognized over the balance of the year. After depreciation and amortization and interest expense, we had an operating loss and negative EPS in the quarter. Finally, we generated positive free cash flow of $12 million in the quarter. Our normal course earnings results slides are in the appendix of our earnings presentation, which is available on our IR web page. Let me provide some clarity on our cost structure. 2/3 of our cost structure is variable, which provides protection in a downside scenario. Based on 2019 results, our variable costs are comprised of: approximately $1.3 billion of Travel Network incentive expenses, which are variable and tied to bookings volumes; approximately $250 million in semi-variable technology hosting costs; and approximately $500 million in headcount-related and other costs, including R&D labor. This is where our cost-savings initiative is targeted. Only 1/3 or $1 billion based on 2019 results is fixed. This includes critical headcount, including maintenance, R&D labor and fixed technology hosting costs. A high proportion of variable cost affords us the ability to take further actions if needed. In response to COVID-19, we announced a $200 million cost-savings initiative in March. In April, we increased the scope and are now targeting $325 million in total cost savings in 2020.

Breaking down the $325 million. $200 million is related to onetime or temporary headcount-related savings. 1/3 of our staff is currently furloughed, and we have also implemented pay reductions and suspense suspended certain benefits. $50 million is related to permanent headcount-related cost savings. This is the expected 2020 benefit, not the annual run rate savings. $50 million is related to technology project delays. As Sean described, outside of our technology transformation and migration to Google Cloud, we have paused investment in the strategic initiatives discussed on our previous earnings call. Finally, $25 million is related to third-party and vendor-spend savings. The expected cost savings resulted from these activities have been included in the liquidity analysis that I will discuss shortly. These are tough actions, but we have the ability to further increase the scope if necessary. I want to thank my Sabre colleagues around the world for their support during this challenging time. In addition to the cost reductions, we have taken several liquidity actions and expect to have significant liquidity to withstand a prolonged downturn. In addition to $325 million in expected 2020 cost savings, we suspended dividends and share repurchases in mid-March, effective after the March 30, 2020, payment of $39 million. For context, we spent $154 million on dividends and $78 million on share repurchases in 2019. We drew down on our revolver in the amount of $375 million.

We raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of senior secured and exchangeable notes. Final pricing was 9.25% on $775 million in senior secured notes due in 2025 and 4% on $345 million exchangeable notes also due in 2025. We although we were in compliance with our Q1 leverage ratio requirements as of March 31, 2020, we believe that a material travel event disruption has occurred. Therefore, we expect our leverage ratio covenant under our amended and restated credit agreement will be suspended. Current carrier capacity forecasts lead to our expectation that this suspension will remain for the balance of the year. Effective May 1, 2020, Sabre and Farelogix agreed to terminate the acquisition agreement. We recorded a termination fee of $46 million in the first quarter, $25 million of which is related to advances already paid and $21 million in aggregate termination fees that have already been paid in the second quarter of 2020. Taking a closer look at our liquidity position. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $684 million. We have a cash balance of approximately $1.7 billion pro forma for the following items: $1.1 billion raised in our recent notes offerings, less $30 million in refunds owed to airlines for Q1 cancellations; $52 million in incentive payments delayed from Q1 into Q2; $44 million in cancellation reserve; and the $21 million in termination fees paid to Farelogix in Q2.

We estimate we have total liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion after taking into account minimum cash to operate the business of $150 million. We estimate we have a monthly cash burn rate of approximately $80 million in a 0-bookings environment. This estimate is comprised of: $50 million revenue from the 15% of our revenue not tied to travel volumes; $80 million in fixed costs from our $1 billion in previously described annual fixed costs; $20 million in variable costs, reflecting a decline in Travel Network incentives and semi-variable technology hosting costs as well as the impact of cost savings initiatives; and $30 million in other cash expenditures, which is primarily interest, debt repayment and capex. This all results in our expectations for approximately 18 months of liquidity in a 0-bookings, no-travel environment. Given that we believe we have more than one and half years of liquidity, we do not expect to participate in the CARES Act loan program for the aviation industry. As a reminder, we withdrew the guidance provided on our February earnings call and are not issuing guidance at this time.

With that, I'd like to turn it back to Sean.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Doug, and thank you to our Sabre teammates around the world for their dedication to serving our customers, shareholders and each other during this difficult time. With that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra.

Ashish Sabadra -- Analyst

Thanks for taking my question. A Quick question on what percentage of your bookings are corporates and international booking? And just if you can any provide any color because the concern is that those might take even longer to recover compared to the leisure bookings. So any color on those terms.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Ashish, can you restate that question again. You were breaking up quite a bit.

Ashish Sabadra -- Analyst

Sorry about that. Can you Sorry. Sorry about that. I was just wondering what percentage of your bookings are coming from corporate and international bookings because the concern is those might take longer to recover compared to the leisure bookings.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. If you look at I mean if you go back just historically, the balance of the bookings we had were actually more on the, what I would consider to be in the North American side; international side, making up a smaller percentage of that. If you look at the bookings themselves, I mean, historically, we have a decent amount of the corporate bookings that are in place because of our penetration with TMCs versus what I would consider to be more the OTA side of the equation. As you look at bookings now, as I mentioned, there really are no bookings. So in measurement, relative to what we're seeing right now, Ashish, what I would share is, and this is very early on in what we're seeing take place, we are seeing OTA bookings picking up a little bit faster than the corporate booking side of the equation. And I'm talking very, very small numbers as we track really where the trough was and what we're seeing as it relates to last week's bookings. And this is on a year-over-year workday-adjusted basis that we're tracking that.

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Ashish, if you take a look historically, 70% of our bookings come through the TMCS, 30% comes from the OTAs. And obviously, most of the OTA stuff is going to be leisure, and majority of the TMCs is going to be business-related travel.

Ashish Sabadra -- Analyst

Okay. That's helpful. And just a question on there are concerns about potential bankruptcy risk for agencies or airlines, just given the challenged travel environment. Can you just talk about, is there any potential risk to Sabre because of any bankruptcies at the agencies or airlines?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I'm not going to speculate. We get the question a lot. I mean everybody is working through liquidity, managing how do they get additional liquidity and what's out there, Ashish. It's very early on in what's taking place, where I keep driving people back to the actions that we've taken because we were very aggressive in what we did early on, one from a cost perspective and then going for liquidity. And in doing that, I am of the belief that there will be a travel ecosystem in the future. I do think it's going to be a smaller travel ecosystem for a period of time. But we're positioning ourselves to be able to operate in that environment. And that's why Doug has been very adamant of talking about the 0-booking environment and the staying power that we have.

Ashish Sabadra -- Analyst

That's helpful, Sean. And maybe one final question, if I can squeeze in on the Google commercial partnership. So congrats on that. I was wondering if you could provide any color on that front. How should we think about the revenue opportunity there? And is there opportunity for further expansion of that partnership?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I'll kick off, and then I'll let Dave add a little bit to this. But as we talk about, we felt that there were commercial opportunities that what I would consider to be low-hanging fruit that we could begin to execute. The one thing that we're doing is really providing availability data information to Google that and this is essentially reaching out to a number of airlines around the world that they'll be able to use as it relates to Google flight search. So it's one step in what we hope will continue to be a number of other opportunities that are out there. And Dave, I don't know if you'd add anything else to that.

Dave Shirk -- President, Travel Solutions

Yes. No, I would just echo what Sean said. I mean you got to start somewhere. We had a set of innovation projects that could have commercial benefit. This will kick off probably around the Q3 time period. It's small in size, but it's the first step of several that we're trying to work through with Google. So we're pretty happy about the progress with them in the early stages of the relationship.

Ashish Sabadra -- Analyst

Thanks, and all the best.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler.

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Thank you very much. Let me first start by saying, I hope everyone on the calls stays healthy and safe. And also thank you for the detail you've been supplying in today's earnings. A couple of quick questions, if you don't mind. Sabre's GDS air bookings decline was a bit better than the overall industry. Is this U.S. exposure? Or is there some other factors?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

It's primarily going to be U.S. exposure.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay. So why not participate in the CARES Act?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So obviously, we realized that we needed some additional liquidity and the mark quite honestly, the markets opened up. It was taking longer than expected to understand what the CARES Act was going to entail and how and what the terms would be that you'd be able to lend under. And quite honestly once we got the public raise done, quite honestly, we wouldn't be even eligible then for the CARES Act because they are primarily focused on trying to help people have liquidity through the balance of 2020. And obviously, now we have liquidity almost all the way through 2021.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Mark, as you would imagine, we are working on a number of different things, and we were heavily engaged in conversations. I was at the White House, at the Treasury as well as congressional leaders as this is being drafted. But in doing that, we are looking at what that could potentially be for Sabre then. As Doug has stated, we are also looking at other ways of generating liquidity based on how things were essentially progressing on the government side. As you know, there are just numerous balls that were in the air and they were working through it. We were focused and I've learned this from my past, as you work aggressively to focus on your capital and your balance sheet and what you can do because you just don't know. And we knew that essentially the government at the end of the day was a lender of last resource, and we were going to have to prove we were still going to have to prove that the markets were closed to us. So for us, like I said in my comments is we were very focused on acting aggressively to rightsize the business, putting cash into on the balance sheet and then being prepared to just manage through the situation as we see it right now.

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Well done. One last question, if you don't mind. How large was the negative impact of cancellations on revenue in Q1?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

How large was it?

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Yes.

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Well, I mean, you can tell, obviously, there's approximately 20 million bookings and almost $60 million.

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Beautiful. $60 million?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

$60 million in the month of March.

Mark Moerdler -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Perfect, thank you. I appreciate it.

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

All right. Thanks, Mark. Take care.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Josh Baer.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hi, thanks for taking the question. When we think about the future of the industry, is there anything you could share on how to think about changes to contracts, pricing, GDS fees, incentive fees, just in light of the current crisis and expecting a smaller travel market in the medium term?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. At this point in time, I'm not going to speculate. I mean there's a we're working with our customers. The one thing that you look at what takes place as it relates to the relationships we have, they're PB-based, passenger-boarded-based, the booking volume. So when you look at it specifically on the airline and even on the hospitality side, it's transaction-oriented. So there's some forgiveness that's taking place there. On the agency side, it's the incentive piece of it. But I think we're just way too early to even speculate on something like that.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it. And what I appreciate all the detail on the cost structure and liquidity. I think it's very helpful and clear. And obviously, you just raised over $1 billion in capital. Wondering one question on that net leverage covenant. I realize you might have a path for several quarters given the year-over-year travel declines. But should investors think about that, that eventually, whether it's three, six, nine months, you'll be able to amend or replace that loan or the credit agreement there? Like is it is that a concern to you? Or should it be a concern to equity investors?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think you're probably asking a combination of two questions. Well, let me address the leverage issue. More likely than not with the kind of the capacity outlooks that Sean was alluding to, the leverage suspension will probably go all the way through 2021, more likely than not based on what we think is going to happen. So I don't think between now and the end of 2021 and may even go into '22, remember, the maturities of those of the term loan is July of 2022. Obviously, now with the raise behind us and the really good relationship we have with those lending institutions, once we get into the fall and early beginnings of 2021, we'll turn our attention to refinancing the Term Loan A.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Very helpful, thanks.

Operator

The final question is from the line of Jed Kelly.

Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Hey, great, thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me OK?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. We can, Jed. How are you?

Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

I'm doing well. How are you? All right. So yes, just my first question has to do with, as you sort of look at realigning your cost structure over the next two to three years, is there a path to where your medium-term cash flow can get to pre-2019 2019 levels quicker under a lower revenue base?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Obviously, the actions that we've taken now, obviously, will help us as we move in 2021. A lot will depend on how fast that market returns, Jed, to be honest with you. Because obviously, that some of the variable costs will kick back in. The incentive payments will kick back in. Some of the variable hosting costs will ought to come back. But I do think that as we enter kind of a ""normal recovery,"" we'll we will be in a better cost position than we were coming into out of 2019.

Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

And then as everybody in travel seems to be guiding for a multiyear recovery, is that going to be more dependent on a vaccine science breakthrough? Or do you see that hopefully coming relatively quickly, but it's just going to be more of an economic drag? I mean how do you kind of look at the pace of the travel recovery?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I mean, I think everybody's got a different opinion on this, Jed. I here's what I tell my team, and this is what I talk to my family about. ""Tell me when you're ready to go out to a restaurant. Tell me when you're ready to go to a movie. Tell me when you're ready to go to a ballpark. Tell me when you're ready to get on an airplane."" And I think you just got to be somewhat basic at this point in time. Listen, I think everybody believes that there's a vaccination that would help. But we're taking this one step at a time right now. And I go back to the actions that we've taken that we put ourselves in what I consider to be an enviable position to manage through the crisis.

Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

All right. And then before this, there was sort of some of the airlines, I guess, we're being confrontational as we would try to drive direct bookings. Does this provide an opportunity for, I guess, more constructive partnerships going forward? And how do you see partnering with airlines evolving in the next three years?

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Well, I'll probably just look backwards and just talk about since I've really taken over the organization that's been very focused on constructive relationship with airlines, making sure that as they think about modern-day retailing and being able to do what they want to do that we continue to move forward. And as I look into the future, our strategy and focus and working with our airline customers, our hotel customers as well as our agency customers has not changed at all.

Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Thank you. And stay safe

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

All right, yes, thank you.

Operator

You do have a follow-up question from the line of Josh Baer.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hi, I just wanted to pop back in on the 15% of revenue not tied to travel volumes, I see in the prepared remarks that in the cash burn, you assume $50 million in revenue from that bucket, which would be on a monthly basis. So that's $600 million for the year. And like looking at FY 2019, that was about 15% of revenue. So is the assumption that, that is very durable? Or could you I guess could you talk a little bit about the different types of revenue that's in that 50 15%. Is any of that at risk even though it's not tied to passenger volume?

Doug Barnett -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we Yes. Josh, we did take a look at that, and we didn't really think much of what was at risk. It's certain things that some of our customers are on a subscription basis. Some of it's back-office subproducts that we provide to agencies. Some of it some of the work we do in hospitality and the DX side. So we really didn't think when we took a look at it, we didn't slip it down a little bit. I think the other thing I want to mention when we talk about the $50 million, just to give you a sense of how conservative it has been, obviously, in some of particularly in the Airline Solutions contracts, there are minimums. We've assumed in that $50 million that all minimums are waived. So the airlines don't even have to comply with their minimum requirements. So I think we've taken a conservative approach to that $50 million.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it. Great, thank you.

Operator

I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sean Menke.

Sean Menke -- President & Chief Executive Officer

Great. As always, guys, I like I want to thank you for taking the time to hear the update on what's taking place here at Sabre. Once again, I want to thank my Sabre team members around the world for everything they're doing. I really do appreciate it. With that, everybody, please stay safe. Thank you very much.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, or you’ve been following it, then you probably already know that the company has been buying back large quantities of its own shares for years. Indeed, the number of shares of Apple Inc. stock outstanding has been declining steadily since 2013.

You very likely understand that when fewer and fewer shares of a stock are available to the public, this tends to push up the price per share. After all, when the supply of any good or service declines – and if all other factors remain the same -- the price of that good or service will rise.

[caption id=""attachment_565496"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""400""] Kaspars Grinvalds/Shutterstock.com[/caption]

Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

Decline In Apple Inc Stocks Held By The Public

The accompanying table shows the steady decline in Apple shares held by the public since 2013, when there were 6.57 billion shares outstanding. As of May 5, 2020, that total had fallen to just 4.33 billion – a decline of 37.1%.

Date Billions of Shares Outstanding 01/11/2013 6.57 01/10/2014 6.24 01/09/2015 5.82 01/08/2016 5.54 01/20/2017 5.25 01/19/2018 5.07 01/18/2019 4.72 05/04/2020 4.33

Now we get to the interesting part of the saga. Apple has announced plans to continue buying its outstanding shares, even though its price has risen substantially during the last couple of months.

The Effect Of Stock Purchases On The Stock Price

While there is no guaranty that the company will continue buying up its outstanding shares in future years, investors should definitely take into account the effect that future stock purchases will have on the price of Apple Inc. stock.

Its price has been hit by a quadruple whammy in just the last year or so. First, we have the Trump tariffs imposed on manufactured goods – think iPhone – imported from China. Then, in the first quarter of this year, the spreading coronavirus decimated Apple’s sales in China. In short order, when that nation’s entire economy was shut down, again Apple was hit disproportionately, and the company’s sales were affected all over the globe. And finally, as the virus continues to spread, there is no telling how badly the company’s sales outlook will be for the rest of the year.

So one may ask why the stock is currently selling just thirty dollars below its all-time high. Well, those continuing buy-backs certainly didn’t hurt.

Well that and overseeing a nearly $10 billion market cap company that similar to other work-from-home tech outfits such as Slack and Zoom is experiencing a transformational moment in their relatively short histories. The importance of the time is not lost on Houston — who co-founded Dropbox in 2007 with Arash Ferdowsi —as he is pushing his team to develop new tools for users that cater even more to a future of working from home.

It’s a world where we will need greater insight into what co-workers are thinking, feeling and doing since we won’t be in the office (at all or not that much). This is the void the likes of Dropbox, Zoom, Slack and others will look to fill in an effort to get us all working collaboratively and efficiently.

“And so what we're thinking about is in our products, given that you lose that human connection, how do you recreate the experience of being together in the app? How do you make it so that you can see what's been going on on your team in a much more organized and focused way? Because a lot of the messaging tools are great. But if you leave your computer for a day and come back, you have to page through all these chats, transcripts and emails and try to piece together what's going on. So what if that were easier? So that's a lot of what we're focused on. From a product standpoint, how do we pull all this together and organize your work and help you focus,” Houston explains to Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Dropbox has already seen an uptick in business as a byproduct of the shift to working from home during the health crisis.

Trial subscriptions to Dropbox’s business and individual services have increased 40% and 25%, respectively, since mid-March. Active users for the company’s new desktop app have surged 60%. Heading into April, Dropbox saw a 20-fold spike in the use of its integration with video calling platform Zoom.

Paying users in the first quarter rose 2.1% sequentially to 14.6 million, ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 14.57 million. Average revenue per user increased to $126.30 from $121.04 a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margins improved to 16.1% from 10.1% last year.

‘Healthy balance of growth and profitability’

The solid start to the year brings Dropbox incrementally closer to the aggressive profit margin forecasts it put out in February. The company said at the time it expects operating margins to reach 28% to 30% by 2024, up from a prior forecast of 20% to 22%.

Worth noting is that those targets came prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that has businesses globally rethinking how they operate and signing up to different services from a Dropbox. Houston won’t say whether the targets— which surprised many on the Street at the time — are now conservative in the wake of COVID-19.

“Well, we've always been focused on delivering a healthy balance of growth and profitability. And when we felt that we had an opportunity to update our long-term model to reflect the inherent efficiency in the business. And then with given COVID we're heading into a pretty unpredictable background environment. So you know, we'll be watching everything closely,” Houston says.

Only time will tell. But Wall Street stays invested in the Dropbox story — 71% of the sell-side analysts who cover the company rate the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data. The average 12-month price target by the analyst community is $26, suggesting at least 24% upside from current levels.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/antitrust-flexes-anti-big-tech-060000668.html,FB,2020-05-06T06:00:00+00:00,"The latest antitrust movement in the United States creates additional risk for Alphabet GOOG/GOOGL and Facebook FB, but we believe this is already priced in, with both stocksfairly valued. Further, we don't believe investors should be overly concerned about a worst-case scenario.

As the 2020 elections approach, politicians, federal agencies, and international lawmakers have begun to investigate Alphabet's Google, Facebook, and several other Big Tech companies, proposing more stringent enforcement of antitrust laws and some calling for changes to or reinterpretation of existing statutes. However, the consumer welfare interpretation of antitrust law, in place for more than four decades, and recent cases, such as Ohio v. American Express in the U.S. Supreme Court, have set precedents favoring tech companies in general. While other cases, such as the 2011 Microsoft Internet Explorer settlement, do not look favorable, they have created a playbook for tech companies to navigate regulatory scrutiny and prepare for enforcement actions.

Also, several proposed state and federal regulations focus on data privacy and security. We believe Alphabet and Facebook understand the need to improve transparency around their use of data and are well on their way to doing so as they work with European and U.S. regulators.

We expect that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice will aggressively enforce the Clayton Antitrust Act to limit Google's and Facebook's acquisitions and are likely to impose additional fines on past behavior. We believe there is more uncertainty surrounding Facebook, as it is caught in more of a political upheaval during an election year than Google. Still, even in what we believe is the most plausible downside scenario, which includes fines beyond what we view as reasonable based on previous cases and excessively restrictive regulation that will likely harm consumers, our Alphabet and Facebook fair value estimates decline only 10%-15% versus our base case.

Despite antitrust and other regulatory uncertainties surrounding Big Tech, we remain confident that Alphabet and Facebook will sustain their competitive advantages. We don't believe that more fines, fierce enforcement of antitrust laws, or the passing of new ones will allow competitors to overcome the network effects these companies have created.

The consumer welfare interpretation of antitrust law and some past large antitrust cases have set precedent that can benefit Google and Facebook. The disruptive online platforms that Google, Facebook, and the other Big Techs have created could bring new legal interpretations or the creation of additional agencies to oversee the digital markets, but any changes will take years to implement.

Politicians are more likely to show support for antitrust laws and their enforcement as 2020 is an election year. Big Tech companies remain under scrutiny by politicians after the 2016 election. Both sides of the political aisle continue to fault Google and Facebook for lacking data privacy and security and for poor content verification and quality management. The dominance of a few Big Techs has also outraged politicians, which could result in growing calls for reinterpretation of or changes to antitrust statutes. Cooler heads are likely to prevail as the election passes and the realities of the challenges inherent in regulating tech companies set in.

Regulators and politicians continue to focus on data and how it's used. Google and Facebook are not contesting these efforts, as both are seeking compromise or settlements with agencies and lawmakers. Restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence technology have also begun making the rounds in Europe. At the same time, enforcing data portability and interoperability, which may eliminate barriers to entry for competitors, especially among social networks, is being seriously considered.

Antitrust enforcement and further regulations pose a threat to one of Google's and Facebook's intangible assets, data. However, increased restrictions on data access and usage would apply to all companies, not just the industry giants. These two companies' large audiences and continuous consumer engagement are likely to continue to drive demand for their ad inventories, although possibly at lower prices in the short term.

The FTC and DOJ are likely to aggressively enforce the Clayton Act and limit Google and Facebook acquisitions in order to provide newcomers an opportunity to compete effectively. We expect restrictions on mergers and acquisitions to affect top-line growth and push both companies to spend more on research and development.

Facebook has had more antitrust tendencies than Google. There is more uncertainty and risk associated with U.S. antitrust matters surrounding Facebook. The company is currently caught in the political upheaval during an election year. Plus, because Facebook continues to operate mainly in the social network market, potential acquisitions may be more easily defined as horizontal or anticompetitive.

The likeliest negative outcome relative to our base-case assumptions for Alphabet and Google is that they will be excessively fined and face regulations. In contemplating this downside scenario, we reach fair value estimates of $1,188 and $191 per share for Alphabet and Facebook, respectively, 15% and 11% below our current fair value estimates of $1,400 and $215.

Lack of Trust and Concentration of Power Bring Antitrust to Forefront

Given the dominance of large technology companies like Alphabet and Facebook today, regulators and the public are again focused on the impact of such power concentration on competition and consumers. Questions they're asking include: Have prices increased for consumers and advertisers? Have merging companies increased the quality of their services? Have they taken any actions that violate antitrust laws and illegally restrain competition? Has their dominance stifled growth in innovation? Have they created further barriers to entry via intangible assets such as data and intellectual properties?

To answer some of these questions, we think the focus will be on current antitrust laws, precedents that some of the major antitrust cases may have set, possible changes in the interpretation of antitrust laws, additional regulatory steps that may be taken at the state and federal levels, and various changes that the companies have already implemented or are planning.

The two companies currently under the heaviest scrutiny are Alphabet (parent company of Google) and Facebook. Google has a 90% market share in search and a 41% global market share in online advertising, displaying dominance in both markets. Facebook currently holds 59% of the social network market, based on the number of users, and is second to Google in online advertising with a 30% share. The two have attained their market standings organically and through acquisitions. Both wide-moat companies have also created and strengthened their network effect and data moat sources, which have created barriers to entry for competitors and barriers to exit for online users. With these two companies' strong sustainable competitive advantages and further dominance in their markets, government agencies are focusing on Alphabet and Facebook and other Big Tech companies and asking whether they have conducted anticompetitive practices. The agencies and lawmakers could take additional actions that include imposing more fines; changing, creating additional, or increasing the enforcement of antitrust regulations; or even breaking up the two companies. The likeliest scenario is a combination of fines and further regulations, but we don't believe the impact of these potential actions will materially change our estimated intrinsic values for the companies.

They have evolved significantly from the early days of computer games and the first versions of Nintendo and Atari. The days of pixelated screens and limited sounds are a distant memory as video games have become more lifelike than ever. As technology continues to improve, so do video games.

Video game creation has become increasingly complex, and the cost of creating a game to run on one of the major consoles has risen with this greater complexity. It was once unthinkable to sink millions into development costs, but games today can cost tens and even hundreds of millions. This has pushed game development into Hollywood movie territory in terms of production and marketing costs.

The video game sector is immensely large. In fact, it is larger than the movie and music industry combined, and it is only growing. Though it doesn't get the same attention that the movie and music industry does, there are over two billion gamers across the world. That is 26% of the world's population.

It's no surprise that companies want a piece of the pie. Analysts predict that by 2022, the gaming industry will generate $196 billion in revenue. As such, tech companies are looking to get involved in this revenue stream. Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), have all made plays to enter the video game industry.

Streaming and the Involvement of Tech Companies

Nontraditional gaming companies, like Facebook, Apple, and Google, are getting into the industry. The tech industry is looking for ways to make video game streaming as natural as streaming a song on Spotify or a movie on Netflix.

Microsoft (MSFT), which has already been in the gaming industry through its popular Xbox console, launched Project xCloud, which is a video game streaming service that allows users to stream Microsoft's Xbox games to PCs or other devices. The project launched for use in early 2020.

In 2016, Facebook began developing a gaming platform with Unity Technologies, which makes a game development framework for people to make video games. Google launched its program, Stadia, which is Google's cloud gaming service, that allows users to play streaming video games with extremely high quality. It is available through Google's browser, phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

The key goal for all of these companies is to allow players to stream video games without the need of a computer or a video game console, as the world moves more and more to life being centered around the mobile phone. As this trend continues, purchasing physical video games, in the form of cartridges or discs, is starting to go out the window.

Subscription streaming services are the future and will be beneficial to video game companies, like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts, as manufacturing, shipping, and storage costs will all disappear. Subscription services have also allowed for revenue generation to occur throughout the year, whereas traditionally, games were bought during holidays and other big occasion events.

Technical Innovations

Virtual reality is here. Oculus VR, a subsidiary of Facebook, is working hard on improving the quality of the virtual reality headsets it has already released. Oculus VR was purchased by Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion. The Oculus Quest line is Facebook's mid-range offering of the product, which is sold for $399. Facebook expects updated models to be announced for release in 2020.

Video games have already surpassed many other forms of entertainment as far as immersion goes, and virtual reality will add yet another layer. There will also be further experimentation with controls, such as adding voice, touch screens, and gestures to game mechanics when the consoles add peripherals to take in those inputs.

Apple is also targeting the release of a virtual reality headset in 2021 or 2022.

Merchandising

Like Hollywood, the video game industry needs to spin more revenue off of its intellectual property because the product costs a lot to make. Merchandising is already around, with t-shirts, figures, hats, mugs, and more. The Halo series on Microsoft’s Xbox has spread to other forms of content through novels and comic books in addition to an upcoming television series and a long-rumored movie. This may become the approach for all successful video game series to follow.

In fact, the popular video game, Assassin's Creed, a game developed by Ubisoft, was made into a movie in 2016 with prominent actors. Sega's popular Sonic the Hedgehog game was made into a successful movie in 2020, starring well-known actors, and set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game based movie.

Market Demographics Are Expanding

Another trend in the video game industry is the expansion of the market as far as demographics go. People are playing games both earlier and later in life, and the gender mix is nearing par. The top-level gamers competing in the eSports leagues have gained enough recognition that they can apply for the professional athlete visa when entering the U.S. Gaming has a wide appeal, and it is still growing.

Video games have become so popular on a mass scale that certain players stream videos of themselves playing video games at home and make hundreds and thousands of dollars by doing so. This has become another revenue generation sector of the video game market.

Vintage Video Games

As the world becomes nostalgic and we see reboots and remakes of loved films and shows from decades ago, the same is happening for video games. Vintage video games from the early days of the industry are in high demand and have become extremely popular, not only with older players who experienced the games first hand but also with a new generation of players.

Many companies have taken advantage of this nostalgia and released updated versions of their consoles. Nintendo (NTDOF), more than any other company, has successfully taken advantage of this interest in retro video games, by releasing Nintendo Classic Mini and Nintendo Switch, two consoles that allow for playing classic Nintendo video games. This has become a solid revenue stream for companies that were around at the early stages of the industry.

The Bottom Line

The video game industry has always been about innovation. New technology, new controls, and new experiences are to be expected. As the world moves more and more to time spent on their mobile phones, streaming services and mobile phone game playing will become an important arena for revenues, and large tech companies will look to leverage their current framework to get involved."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-college-bound-high-school-seniors-consider-gap-years-140616955.html,FB,2020-05-07T14:06:16+00:00,"Grace Chun, 17, was looking forward to an epic graduation trip to South Korea this summer, a treat before heading off to UC San Diego in September. She and her sister, who is graduating from college this year, were looking at plane tickets and sketching out an itinerary when the coronavirus pandemic suddenly hit.

“We’re all four years apart, and my family was supposed to have three graduations — my brother is graduating from 8th grade and entering high school, I’m graduating from high school, my sister from college,” said Chun, who lives in Torrance, California. The ceremonies have either been canceled or postponed indefinitely.

As high school seniors scramble to pivot summer plans, they are also trying to figure out what their fall semesters will look like. Many have even debated taking time off as institutions figure out how campuses will fully reopen over the next few months as the pandemic continues to push out any return to normalcy.

Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California system, said it’s unlikely the 10 campuses in her purview will fully reopen by the fall. Many universities are refraining from guaranteeing a full return to campus; schools like University of Chicago and Cornell are unlikely to make a decision until June. Princeton will decide in early July, but faculty are preparing for a virtual semester. Most institutions intend to have students on campus but are holding that idea loosely, and developing multiple back-up hybrid scenarios.

After high-stress high school careers, many students were looking forward to their trips abroad, summer jobs, and senior sliding with their friends before leaving their nests.

Some even mourn the loss of academic rigor in the last few weeks of high school, including Karl Kilb IV, 17, who attends a performing arts high school in New York. “I’m learning new piano pieces, but all my school goals are gone. A lot of my goals just had to disappear — there’s nothing to look forward to,” he said.

‘Things could be worse’

Sixteen percent of high school seniors say they definitely or most likely will change their plans to attend college in the fall because of the coronavirus, according to a survey of 1,171 students conducted April 21 through 24 by Art & Science Group, a higher education research firm. This is more than a fivefold increase from the ~3% of students who took time off between high school and college in 2018.

“It’s been a bit crazy. I actually was debating about whether I should take a gap year. But I’ve decided to stay committed and I’ll start in the fall regardless of what happens,” said Will Follana, a 17-year-old high school senior in New York City, who applied early decision to Santa Clara University, which plans to fully reopen its physical campus to over 3,000 undergraduate students come September.

Follana ultimately decided against a gap year because he connected with his future classmates on Facebook (FB) and has been speaking to them on Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram regularly.

“I already found a roommate, I have a few friends already and we’re in touch. It’s hard to take a gap year now and have to wait another year. I want to get my college life started,” he said.

“I also have no idea what I would even do if I took a gap year. It’s hard to say… I decided even if we start the first semester online, things could be worse. I didn't want to be stuck doing nothing because of my gap year.”

Karl Kilb IV, a 17-year-old New Yorker, will be attending The Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at NYU Tisch, where he will be studying music production entrepreneurship (Source: Karl Kilb IV) More

Typically, students consider gap years to travel or get some general education course credits out of the way. Chun said some of her friends are considering taking classes at a local community college prior to starting at a four-year university.

Kilb, the performing arts student, has committed to NYU Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. A pianist and clarinetist, his final weeks of senior year have been hit hard by the lack of in-person classes."

X

The post-coronavirus stock market rally has been powerful, in large part thanks to big-cap techs such as Apple stock and the four FANG internet giants. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are obvious coronavirus plays. Facebook stock and Google stock are seeing heavy usage, though ad spending is a concern. Apple stock delivered a surprise EPS gain, despite its exposure to coronavirus supply and demand issues.

Top Stocks To Buy And Watch

One way to find the best stocks is to look at their IBD Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

Netflix stock is at the top with a perfect 99 out of 99 Composite Rating. Amazon stock and Facebook stock both have 98 ratings. Alphabet stock has a 95 rating and Apple stock has a 90 rating.

Investors should be focusing on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher but it isn't the only metric investors should keep track of.

Apple stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Facebook stock, Google stock and AAPL stock are on SwingTrader.

Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the coronavirus stock market rally on IBD Live.

Facebook Stock

Facebook is the FANG stock closest to being actionable as it forms a cup base with a 224.30 entry point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The FB stock base is 39% deep. Largely that's above what investors should typically be after. But it's not unusual following the huge stock market crash. Facebook stock edged up 0.5% to 212.35 on Friday, climbing 5% for the week.

The relative strength line for Facebook stock is already at new highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500.

On April 29, Facebook reported first-quarter earnings that were mostly in line with expectations. Monthly active users climbed 10% to 2.6 billion as the users logged on the social media site to stay connected amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the company also warned that the increased user activity wouldn't protect it from the pullback it's seeing in online advertising revenue.

Google Stock

The next FANG stock closest to being actionable is Google, which is forming a cup base and closing in on a 1,530.84 buy point. Google stock had fallen 34% from its high on March 23 as fears rose over the Covid-19 outbreak. But the RS line for GOOGL stock hit a new high Friday.

Google stock rose 1.1% to 1,384.34 on Friday, also up 5% for the week.

The parent of Google reported mixed Q1 results last month as advertising revenue from the travel, auto and retail sectors fell. But YouTube revenue rose 33% to $4.038 billion, while Google Cloud revenue surged 52%.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock is extended from either a 383.11 buy point or 393.62 entry. During the bear market, NFLX stock fell more than 26% from a 52-week high in early March.

The FANG stock reported mixed Q1 financial results but it added 15.77 million new subscribers, crushing the 8.2 million subscribers analysts expected. Users went wild for its ""Tiger King"" documentary series, making it the most-streamed show in America in April, according to data analytics firm Parrot Analytics. ""Ozark,"" now in its third season, and the fantasy series ""The Witcher"" have also been popular binge watches.

The coronavirus pandemic has simply accelerated the existing trend toward video on demand and away from traditional pay TV, Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a report.

Netflix stock pulled back after its Q1 results, falling back to the top of its base before reversing higher in bullish fashion. NFLX stock dipped 0.2% to 435.55 on Friday, up nearly 5%. Shares are in a mini-consolidation above the prior base. It's not enough yet to form a proper pattern. But a move above the 449.52 peak could offer another entry into Netflix stock.

Apple Stock

Apple stock hit an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, just before the coronavirus stock market correction. AAPL stock has broken out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35 and is now slightly extended. Apple stock could dip back into the buy zone or form another handle to offer a new entry point, but hasn't shown signs of that yet.

Apple stock rose 2.1% to 310.13 on Friday, capping a 7.3% weekly gain. The RS line for AAPL stock is at a new high.

Apple stock is No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products group.

The consumer electronics company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results in April as demand for services and wearable devices rose. But iPhone revenue fell 6.7% as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones.

Analysts say the pandemic could also delay the release of the iPhone 12, Apple's first expected 5G phone, from its projected September launch to between October and early December.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock broke out of a cup base on April 14 with a buy point of 2,186.05. AMZN stock is currently extended above buy range. Shares rose 0.5% to 2,379.61 on Friday, climbing 4.1% for the week after rebounding from their 21-day line. AMZN stock could offer a new entry if its clears its record high of 2,475. Like Netflix stock, Amazon's short consolidation is far too short to be a proper pattern.

On May 1, Amazon stock tumbled nearly 8% following earnings, after hitting a record high heading into results. Q1 revenue growth beat Wall Street expectations. But earnings fell short and profit guidance was light as the e-commerce giant spends $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, to keep customers and employees safe.

Orders are soaring as customers are forced to stay at home amid the Covid-19 crisis. Amazon said it recently completed previous plans to hire 100,000 workers and will hire an additional 75,000 workers to meet growing demand. Amazon Web Services also is seeing strong demand from the stay-at-home trend.

X

Analysts pinpoint just 11 S&P 500 companies, like materials firm Newmont (NEM) plus communications services companies Netflix (NFLX) and Activision (ATVI), to put up strong results all around. At least in the areas investors watch: Revenue growth, earnings growth and stock price.

That's according to an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and Marketsmith.

These companies' key dimensions — earnings, revenue and stock price — will each jump 10% or more this year, analysts say. All 11 S&P 500 companies also sport lofty IBD Composite Ratings.

And above all, these companies could lead the way beyond the first quarter to what really matters: Recovery.

""This recession is unique, but that might not be all bad news,"" said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ""We've had to flip a switch on the economy, essentially front-loading an entire recession's worth of damage into a couple months, creating some all-time dismal data. But that means we'll eventually be able to flip it back on, supporting a robust recovery.""

Thriving In 2020 Isn't Easy For S&P 500 Companies

Finding S&P 500 companies with across-the-board double-digit growth isn't easy. Growth in just one of these dimensions is hard to find this year. In all three? Nearly impossible.

Consider the statistics. S&P 500 revenue is expected to drop 2.9% this year, says FactSet. Only 45 S&P 500 companies are on pace to boost revenue by 10% or more.

And the S&P 500's profit picture is even worse. Earnings are expected to drop nearly 18% in 2020. And analysts think just 49 companies in the S&P 500 will boost earnings by 10% or more in 2020.

And when the year's over, less than 70 S&P 500 stocks will be higher at all than they were on January 1, analysts say. Consider that the S&P 500 is still down roughly 10% on the year.

So to grow 10% in all three measures is a feat.

Netflix And The Other Top S&P 500

Video streamer Netflix in many ways show how 2020 isn't a disaster for all companies. It's one of six of the all-around winners with a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating.

And if you look closely, you can see why. The company's revenue is seen jumping nearly 23% this year to $24.7 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share at Netflix is on pace to hit $6.41 a share. That's a 55% jump.

What about Netflix' stock? Analysts think it will be worth more than $440 in 12 months. If they're right, that's a 36% gain from where the stock started the year. Keep in mind, though, the stock is already up 34.5% this year. You'll want to make sure you buy it at the right time.

Some S&P 500 All-Around Winners Have Upside Left

Not all S&P 500 all-around winners hit their targets just yet. Look at gold miner Newmont. Analysts think the company's revenue and profit will rise 13.7% and 54%, respectively this year. And the stock is up 48.6% this year to 64.55, explaining the 98 Composite Rating.

But still, the 12-month price target on the stock is higher still, 66.90. And if earnings keep coming in better than expected, there could be more price-target hikes coming.

That's been the case at video-game company Activision. The company is perfectly positioned for more people looking for in-house entertainment.

Analysts think Activision's revenue will jump nearly 12% this year. And earnings are seen gaining 22% in 2020. All told, analysts think the stock will be worth 75.71 in 12 months — a 27% implied gain this year. Shares this year are already up 23% to 73.14. Here's what to consider when looking to buy this stock.

Keep in mind, when companies are doing this well, estimates can still move higher. Activision, for instance, beat first-quarter earnings estimates by a whopping 53% on May 5. And not surprisingly, analysts boosted their profit forecast for the year by 10% in just a month.

Just because the nation is locked down doesn't mean you're locked out of ways to profit. S&P 500 investors can make money, if they know where to look.

Its revenue grew 35% annually to $272 million and beat estimates by $1 million, but its adjusted net loss widened from $40 million to $60 million, or $0.10 per share, which missed expectations by a penny.

Pinterest didn't offer any guidance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it warned that its gross margins would contract as the cost of supporting new users overwhelmed its growth in ad revenue, and its operating expenses would rise. In other words, investors should expect slower revenue growth with wider losses.

Investors clearly weren't pleased with that grim outlook, but is Pinterest still a good long-term investment? Let's take a look at Pinterest's past growth, its plans for the future, and where the stock could end up in five years.

How fast is Pinterest growing?

Pinterest went public last April at $19 per share, but the stock dipped below its IPO price following its latest report. Pinterest's full-year revenue rose 51% in 2019, as its global monthly active users (MAUs) grew 26% to 335 million.

Pinterest's MAUs rose another 26% year over year to 367 million in the first quarter. Its international MAUs climbed 34% to 277 million, and its U.S. MAUs grew 6% to 90 million, but it still generates significantly less average revenue per user (ARPU) overseas.

Wall Street expects Pinterest's revenue to rise just 14% this year due to the pandemic and other macro pressures, but accelerate to 34% growth next year as those headwinds wane. Pinterest is expected to remain unprofitable this year, but possibly generate a slim non-GAAP profit by 2021.

Investors shouldn't put too much faith in those long-term estimates, since the fallout from COVID-19 remains hard to quantify. Nonetheless, Pinterest will likely face sluggish growth this year as advertisers rein in their spending and rising expenses turn its growth in users into a double-edged sword.

What are Pinterest's long-term goals?

Pinterest carved out a niche in the crowded social networking market with virtual pinboards that showcased a user's hobbies and interests.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) chased Pinterest with Instagram's collections and the new Hobbi app, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google challenged Pinterest with a ""Collections"" feature for saving images and search results -- but none of those efforts has curbed Pinterest's growth yet.

To differentiate its platform, Pinterest launched ""shoppable"" pins and allowed retailers to upload their entire catalogs. Last year, Cowen & Co. claimed 48% of Pinterest's users used the platform to find and shop for products, compared to just 14% of Facebook's users and 10% of Instagram's users.

Pinterest is well suited for apparel, home goods, and travel, since users can passively convince their followers to buy the same products or experiences. That cycle is arguably more organic than the creation of targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google, and makes it a potential leader in the ""social shopping"" space. Its long-standing partnership with Shopify, which allows smaller merchants to sell their products on Pinterest, could complement that growth.

Another top priority for Pinterest is the improved monetization of its international users, who now account for over three-quarters of its MAUs. Its international ARPU jumped 76% annually to $0.13 last quarter, but that was dwarfed by its domestic ARPU, which grew 18% to $2.66. Closing that gap could require some margin-crushing investments.

Pinterest also wants to diversify its ads away from the apparel, home, and travel sectors, while encouraging users to pin more videos. Those efforts could strengthen its defenses against fierce rivals like Instagram, which also offers shoppable posts on its larger platform.

A promising company with a lot to prove

Pinterest is still growing, but its losses are widening and its stock isn't cheap at about eight times this year's projected sales. Facebook, which is firmly profitable, trades at less than 8 times this year's sales.

Pinterest's MAUs could continue rising over the next five years, but the costs of maintaining that growing user base could offset its ad revenue and make it tough to ever generate a profit. Meanwhile, the expansion of the nascent social shopping market could eliminate Pinterest's first mover's advantage as other platforms promote their shoppable posts. Its overseas growth could decelerate as regional competitors launch similar apps.

In short, Pinterest is a promising company that still has a lot to prove. I believe it could head higher over the next five years, but constant pressure from competitors and concerns about its losses could prevent it from outperforming its bigger industry peers."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-pops-11-amid-potential-101424649.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T10:14:24+00:00,"Shares in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) surged as much as 11% in pre-market U.S. trading amid reports that Amazon.com (AMZN) is interested in buying the debt-strapped theatre operator.

The world’s largest online retailer has held talks with AMC over a potential takeover, the Daily Mail on Sunday reported without saying where it got the information from. However, it is not clear if the discussions will lead to a deal, the report stated.

Amazon has not yet ventured into the cinema industry, while AMC is grappling with the financial fallout from theatre closures tied to the coronavirus pandemic. The world’s largest theatre operator is reportedly on the cusp of bankruptcy turning it into an attractive acquisition target.

AMC shares have almost halved since the coronavirus outbreak this year giving the theatre operator a market value of $427 million. The stock soared as much as 11% to $4.56 in U.S. pre-market trading.

Commenting on the reported acquisition talks, Eric Wold, analyst at B. Riley FBR said that he would be surprised if a purchase likely be for cash (and not stock) by Amazon would appeal to AMC's major shareholders at a time when the stock is down near all-time lows.

“Although we have not anticipated that acquiring a theater circuit would be on the top of the strategy road maps for the major film studios - especially with the increased focus on the growth potential of streaming subscription offerings - we have not been able to completely rule out this possibility,” Wold wrote in a note to investors. “We would view increased control over the theatrical window through the acquisition of a large exhibitor as providing Amazon both an incremental earnings stream from its own films and an attractive marketing vehicle to drive additional subscribers being exposed to the studio's films.”

Wold maintained his Hold rating on AMC stock with a $4 price target

The remainder of Wall Street analysts also have a more bearish outlook on AMC’s stock. The assigned 8 Holds and 3 Sells add up to a Moderate Sell consensus rating. The $4.14 average price target implies limited upside potential in the shares in the coming 12 months. (See AMC stock analysis on TipRanks).

Wall Street analysts and investors don't respect Ken Fisher much. We have never heard of Ken Fisher's stock pitches move stocks the way Bill Ackman or David Tepper moves the markets. Nevertheless Ken Fisher has been able to deliver decent returns to grow his fund's AUM to nearly $100 billion. That's nothing to sneeze at.

In this article we are going to take a look at Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks. During the first quarter Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks delivered an average loss of only 6%, vs. a loss of nearly 20% for the S&P 500 Index. That return was even better than the average return of top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of 6.9% during the first quarter. As you can guess top hedge fund stock picks is a very fertile area to look for good stocks to beat the market.

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years.

Keeping this in mind, let's now take a look at Ken Fisher's top 5 stock picks at the end of March.

The fifth largest position in billionaire Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio was Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Ken Fisher had nearly $2.6 billion invested in the Chinese giant. Alibaba Group Holding was also the fourth most popular stock among all hedge funds at the end of December. We believe Alibaba shares can reach $400 over the next 3-5 years.

The fourth largest position in Fisher's portfolio was Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Fisher had nearly $3.2 billion invested in Amazon.com Inc shares at the end of March. Amazon shares delivered total gains of 22% since then, potentially giving Fisher total gains of more than $650 million. Legendary investor Bill Miller doesn't think Amazon.com is a good stock to be invested in after its strong 2020 gains. In the following video you can watch why Bill Miller thinks it doesn’t make sense today to invest in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and 6 other recession stocks that performed well so far this year.

Bill Miller's hedge fund returned 120% in 2019. So, investors shouldn't hastily dismiss his point.

The third biggest position in Ken Fisher's portfolio at the end of March was Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), valued at $3.3 billion. Visa Inc. was the worst performing top 5 stock in Ken Fisher's portfolio in Q1, losing 14.1%. However, Visa shares recovered most of their Q1 losses so far in the second quarter. Visa has been a hedge fund favorite for a long time but it really never got too cheap for us to recommend it to our subscribers.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the second biggest position in Fisher's 13F portfolio. Fisher had $3.4 billion invested in Microsoft Corporation at the end of March and those shares are worth 17% more today. Microsoft Corporation is one of the most valuable companies in the world today, so it isn't a surprise for us to see this stock near the top of Fisher's portfolio.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-absence-drag-lagging-asia-043225158.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T04:32:25+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. technology stocks are on their hottest winning streak of the year, yet those gains aren’t necessarily translating to the same boost for their peers in Asia.

The tech benchmark Nasdaq 100 Index, heavily skewed toward the so-called FAANG stocks -- Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- as well as top position Microsoft Corp., has now rallied for six straight days. It has rebounded 33% since a low in March as investors piled into technology and biotech shares seen as winners amid the social-distancing lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.

There’s no equivalent tech mainboard in Asia, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index the closest comparable. It’s up a comparatively weak 24% since mid-March, and the top stocks in the gauge, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., have lagged that gain. Tencent Holdings Ltd., the online gaming and social-media services giant that analysts expect will report Wednesday an 18% revenue increase amid the virus outbreak, isn’t part of that index.

While the top of the Nasdaq 100 enjoys a more diverse mix -- Google, Netflix and Facebook leveraging demand for online and social-media services from consumers stuck at home, alongside Amazon’s online delivery -- the Asia Pacific index is largely dominated by chipmakers TSMC and Samsung. They account for more than a third of the gauge.

The coronavirus pandemic has been a net negative for chipmaker stocks worldwide. Despite growth in data centers, they’ve been hit by concerns about lower end-market demand for new personal computers, smartphones and autos, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anand Srinivasan and Marina Girgis wrote in a May 1 note.

Tencent not being part of the Asia Pacific tech index is also hurting it. After falling less than its peers during the initial market downturn, the stock is up 14% for the year, climbing to a two-year high on Monday.

Global mobile game sales hit a record for the week ended May 3, according to Sensor Tower, with holidays in China and Japan also helping gains, BI’s Matthew Kanterman and Vey-Sern Ling wrote in a note Monday. “Growth should continue above the long-term market potential for the duration of the pandemic, likely through 2Q,” they said.

Tencent was also included as a “select stock pick” as internet, health-care and property sectors are among those to benefit from China’s upcoming National People’s Congress, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Pierre Lau wrote in a May 11 note.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffet-bezos-blackrock-betting-big-230000112.html,FB,2020-05-06T23:00:00+00:00,"By the time giant high-tech, cash-burning companies like Uber catch on to the $30-trillion-plus mega trend of sustainable investing, their competition may have caught up.

Big money is shifting its capital to companies that are smart enough to figure out how to mitigate risks related to sustainability and climate crises, and still turn a profit.

Uber does neither. But a new entrant on the high-tech mobility scene does.

A global pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of tradition and there’s no turning back. That’s why sustainable investments wildly outperformed conventional in Q1 2020, and the world’s biggest hedge funds are betting trillions that this is the new path to profit.

Sustainability is now the name of the game, and nothing has made that clearer than COVID-19. This is the biggest “Emperor’s New Clothes” story in decades.

The pandemic has laid bare most major industry segments in the world, from oil and gas to travel and transportation--and not the least, ride-sharing, an explosive trend itself that is now getting a dose of the new reality.

With $30 trillion and counting pointing the way, an innovative high-tech mobility company such as Canada’s Facedrive (TSX.V:FD) has a good chance of grabbing a slice of Uber’s market share by turning ride-sharing into a sustainable industry.

Uber is neither profitable nor sustainable.

But Facedrive, plotting a pathway ahead of this trend, is positioning itself to be both.

How? By listening to Big Capital and turning environmental concern into the new industry gold standard.

More specifically, by transforming ride-sharing from one of the worst polluters into a more carbon-neutral endeavor that offers riders a choice of EVs and hybrids and plants trees along the way to offset emissions for those riders who don’t make that choice.

How To Make Money Under Current Circumstances

Not only will a company’s pandemic response be a major determinant of how they are graded in the future, but so will their response to every conceivable crisis the future may have in store, from climate change to another pandemic and everything in between.

Even before COVID-19, sustainable funds were outperforming their conventional counterparts throughout 2019. The pandemic simply proved up the trend and convinced big capital that this is where the smart money goes.

Between 2016 and 2109, impact investing grew 34%. Since then, the surge has been “skyward” according to Nigel Green, CEO of the deVere Group.

“Increasingly companies will only survive and thrive if they operate with a nod from the wider court of public approval. It has underscored the complexity and interconnectedness of our world in terms of demand and supply, in trade and commerce – and how these can be under threat if not sustainable,” says Green.

That brings us full circle to Facedrive, and the masterminds behind this Canadian product of Ontario’s version of “Silicon Valley”, who latched onto the sustainability-as-profit model way back in 2016 when it was just emerging as a potential trend.

When they launched in 2019 in Canada, it was precisely at the time that sustainable investing was a solid mega-trend.

And now, amid a global pandemic, they are expanding--and, again, the timing couldn’t be better. COVID-19 has shown us exactly how deeply interconnected our basic systems of survival are, whether it’s to battle a virus or fight climate change.

Story continues

For Facedrive, it’s about creating a profitable version of ride-sharing that recognizes mutually beneficial relations with communities, people, and the planet. That means improving on Uber’s mandate. That means bringing a solution to Uber’s biggest problems: Pollution without profit.

A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that the average (U.S.) ride-hailing trip results in 69% more pollution than whatever transportation option it displaced.

That's a huge number, that scientists estimate is actually higher in densely populated areas. In this age of green investing, this is a data-point that green-conscious customers everywhere are finding hard to swallow. But now, they don't have to. With Facedrive, they can contribute to planting a tree every time they take a ride. It gives consumers a choice they have never had before.

The fact that Uber hasn’t made a dime in a decade only pushes the ESG investment thesis further. A decade on and Uber is still only just hoping to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020 - also a year in which it will lose more than $1 billion.

It doesn’t pay to stubbornly resist the battle against climate change. It pays to rush to the front line, as Facedrive has.

Monetizing Sustainability: The Holy Grail

What’s changed is this: Under investor pressure, enough companies are beginning to figure out how to make sustainability profitable because lack of sustainability isn’t turning out to be the cash cow they thought it was.

If you can’t monetize it, then your $100 billion valuation dreams will never be realized. Again, ask Uber.

Facedrive is already on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle, providing discounted rides for healthcare workers, developing the new TraceSCAN app to help keep communities and families safe by detecting instances of infection, and organizing a medical delivery service that keeps high-risk groups from unnecessary exposure.

And all the while, it’s planting trees, battling climate change right along with coronavirus.

When the dust settles on this global pandemic, social responsibility, sustainability, good governance, and impact will be remembered most.

But there’s more money expected to be made here, post-COVID-19. Facedrive’s entire ecosystem is about revenue from the rider relationship. It’s about more than just getting from Point A to Point B. It’s about an all-inclusive experience--the only thing outside of sustainability and impact that attracts millennial investors these days.

This is where ride-sharing becomes what it was always meant to be: A high-tech business, rather than just a taxi replacement.

That means everything from medicine and “merch” to short and long-distance mobility, healthy choice food deliveries, and much more. It’s sustainability on wheels.

Will Smith, whose Bel Air Athletics clothing brand is betting that Facedrive is the ride of the future. That’s why he’s co-branding an entire line of merch with Facedrive.

It’s also why WestBrook Inc., the company he shares with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, is partnering with this bold startup that is planning on expanding globally to challenge Uber for the throne.

Even better: It’s green and in line with Facedrive principles. Not only is everything being made in North America, but the goal is to ensure by next year that all materials are 100% sustainably sourced.

Some 1,000 new products co-branded by Bel Air and Facedrive are ready to launch, with pre-orders coming soon on the Facedrive website.

The company is also rolling out a comprehensive health initiative, timed for rapid deployment to the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Facedrive Healthcare includes everything from discounted rides for healthcare workers and specialized vehicles for anyone with additional needs to contactless delivery of essential over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies, including high-tech management of automatic refills.

Facedrive Eats, which is now piloting in six cities in Ontario and is planning to expand to other regions soon.

For investors looking for the next big trend, this is it. There’s money in mitigation, and it has nothing to do with politics.

It’s about people--with Millennials in the lead--finally realizing that climate change is a very real threat to our lives and livelihoods. And big money follows the consumers because that’s where the profit is. Pandemic risk increases as the planet heats up, and so does global financial instability, and they feed on each other.

Uber with its massive cash burn and its negative footprint, doesn’t align with the $30-trillion trend that is reshaping the investment world. Facedrive does, and it’s on a sustainable monetization binge.



Other companies looking to capitalize on the $30 trillion sustainability push:



Microsoft (MSFT) is a prime example of a company pushing sustainability into the center stage of its operations. In fact, Microsoft is going above and beyond in its carbon emissions pledge. It is aiming to be carbon neutral in the next decade. Not only is the tech giant taking a leadership role in reducing its carbon emissions, but it is also at the forefront of a technological wave that is actively helping other companies curb their emissions, as well.



Microsoft has created numerous resources to help monitor and evaluate the impact of different businesses on the environment, helping gather data to better understand where and how the world can improve. Additionally, Microsoft is creating tools to better regulate the use of water and curb the world’s growing waste problems.



As the world’s leading solar and wind energy producer, NextEra Energy (NEE) is playing a pivotal role in the path towards sustainability. In fact, in 2018, the company was the number one capital investor in green energy infrastructure, and the fifth largest investor across all sectors.



In addition to its already massive impact on global climate change, it has a plan to invest another $55 billion in American energy infrastructure in the next two years. All while maintaining a firm commitment to reduce its dependency on foreign oil. Since 2001, it has weaned itself off foreign oil almost completely, reporting a 98% reduction over the past 20 years. Even more enticing, however, is its commitment to building shareholder value. Over the past 15 years, shareholders have seen 945% returns.



Even Big Oil can’t escape the investor pressure to go green. And no other oil major takes this more seriously than Total (TOT). In fact, Total has pledged to work towards all of the United Nations’ sustainability goals. From the environment and climate to the people working with and impacted by its business, Total is taking the goals to heart.



Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its day to day operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It’s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach.



Other tech giants are getting involved, as well. Both Facebook and Google have embarked on similar paths to Microsoft, with massive business-wide changes with the goal of becoming leaders in the sustainability space.



Facebook (FB), for example, is taking an innovative approach in its vision to reduce its carbon footprint. It’s data centers are some of the most energy-efficient - and water-efficient - in the world. And it’s only getting started. By the end of 2020, Facebook is aiming to have all of its data centers running on 100% renewable energy. Additionally, Facebook has committed to adding over 4.0 GW of renewable energy to the grid.



Facebook has even gone a step further with its focus on building more sustainable workplaces. It’s building designs incorporate a number of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all products consumed on site.



Google (GOOGL), for its part, is focused on raising the bar for smart use of the world’s resources. Like Facebook, Google is creating sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and workplaces. It is also leveraging artificial intelligence to develop more sustainable energy use.



Google is also focused on creating a sustainable supply chain. It is committed to improving the lives of everyone connected to its products, from miners to drivers and beyond. Additionally, it is actively reducing its environmental impact by working with suppliers to provide them with the tools they need to become more energy efficient.

Canadian companies are doing their part as well:



Take telecom giant Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B), for example. Shaw is taking a leadership role among Canadian telecom providers through its use of renewable energy, In fact, it is one of the biggest customers of Bullfrog Power which sources its electricity from a blend of wind energy and hydropower. It is also building its own portfolio of clean energy investments.



BCE Inc (TSX:BCE)) is another Canadian telecom giant going to great lengths to reduce its carbon footprint. For the past 25 years, BCE has been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Their environmental management system (EMS) has been certified to be ISO 14001-compliant since 2009.



Boralex Inc. (TSX:BLX) is a homegrown Canadian renewable firm. It has had a great influence in the adoption of renewable electricity domestically, and it’s even branching out into the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The company’s primary energies are produced through wind, hydroelectric, thermal and solar sources and help power the homes of many people across the world.



Polaris Infrastructure (TSX:PIF) is another renewable firm taking a slightly more focused approach. The company’s biggest projects are in Latin America. It’s Nicaragua geothermal project, for example, is already producing over 77 MW of renewable electricity. And in Peru, its El Carmen and 8 de Augusto power plants, is set to produce a combined 17MW of electricity in the near future.



Westport Fuel Systems (TSX:WPRT) is a renewable energy provider for the transportation industry. it provides systems for less impactful fuels, such as natural gas. In North America alone, there are over 225,000 natural gas vehicles. But that’s nothing compared to the global number of natural gas vehicles, which total over 22.5 million.

The episode then dives into all things Apple AAPL, to see if investors should consider buying the iPhone giant’s stock for safety during the pandemic.

Wall Street and investors appear to be looking ahead with hope that the global economy can start to return to something relatively close to normal. That said, the coronavirus still hangs over the world, and volatility could remain amid broad uncertainty.

Our Zacks earnings estimates also keep falling sharply for the second quarter, which is hopefully where the full impact of the coronavirus shutdown takes place.

The tech sector has proven resilient. And the FAANG stocks have become safe-havens, with Facebook FB, Google GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Netflix NFLX, and Apple all in the green in 2020, with the S&P 500 still down 9%.

With this in mind, Apple topped our Q2 fiscal 2020 estimates at the end of April. The company’s wearables and services units remain growth drivers and helped pick up the slack for the iPhone. Apple still faces setbacks on both the supply and demand sides, but its cash, dividend, and buybacks make it a safe play during these unprecedented times.

Apple stock climbed again on Monday as it races back toward its 52-week highs, alongside Microsoft MSFT. Investors should also note AAPL stock is trading at a solid discount against MSFT in terms of forward 12-month sales estimates.

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:

Is Fear Stemming from Dividend Cuts Overblown? Stocks to Gain

Coronavirus-induced economic mayhem has flared up investors’ concerns about companies’ ability to maximize shareholder value going forward. The fears do have reasons. There have been rampant cuts in share repurchases, one of the popular tools to have charged up Wall Street time and again for all these years.

Even promised dividends have not been safe lately. Liquidity crisis at corporations called for prudent cash management and led to such a step. Per the S&P Dow Jones Indices, March 2020 dividend announcements were negative. There were 13 cuts, with 10 being suspensions, making for a total forward impact of $13.9 billion. Last time it turned negative was in second-quarter 2009.

As of May 4, about 25% in the S&P 500 had suspended guidance for future quarters, with at least 30 cutting or pausing dividend payouts in order to fight the economic-fallout caused by the novel coronavirus.

All Is Not Lost

Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley indicated that bullishness has been noticed in the dividend futures market, which reflects investor views about future dividend payments by the S&P 500 companies.

Per Morgan Stanley, prices in the dividend futures market have shown better correlation with stock prices than actual earnings forecasts. Dividend futures market currently shows the market expecting company dividends to fall 15% this year versus a 23% decline during the Great Financial Crisis.

Most dividend hikes came from the financial sector in recent times. Of the 19 companies to hike dividends in the second quarter, six belonged to the financial sector. Nineteen S&P 500 companies increased their dividends during April.

Morgan Stanley believes that implied 15% haircut in S&P 500 dividends “may overstate the likely dividend cuts this year.” “Dividend futures have already bottomed and rebounded sharply, which is in sharp contrast to the [the next 12 months’] EPS forecasts,” according to the note.

Which Dividend Stock to Bet On?

Overall, the S&P 500 investors should expect a 4% to 5% cut in dividends this year, per a S&P Dow Jones Indices’ strategist. So, it is better not to fall for the yield trap as high returns are always involved with high risks. It is better to go for quality picks or for those stocks that have strong financials which can continue to support dividend payments over the long term. Dividend growth stocks are good bets in this regard.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few stocks that have announced or raised dividends amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apple – Dividend Yield 0.99%

iPhone maker hiked dividends by 6.49% to $0.82 on Apr 30.

Johnson& Johnson – Dividend Yield 2.56%

The pharma giant hiked dividends by 6% to $1.01 on Apr 14.

Costco – Dividend Yield 0.92%

On Apr 15, the seller of high volumes of foods and general merchandise (including household products and appliances) raised 7.69% to $0.70 per share.

Procter & Gamble – Dividend Yield 2.73%

The consumer products company raised its dividends by 6% to $0.7907 per share on Apr 14.

Newmont Corporation – Dividend Yield 0.87%

One of the world's largest producers of gold with several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia and Ghana declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 a share, in line with its January announcement that talked about boosting its dividend to about $1 a share annually.

Best Stocks To Buy — And When To Buy Them

When looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.

Market Direction: The best time to buy stocks is when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market outlook is ""uptrend under pressure"" or ""market in correction,"" it's best to keep your powder dry and wait for a new rally to take hold. (Here's how to easily check current market conditions.)

If you stay patient and wait for a stock to form and break out of a chart pattern, you significantly reduce your risk and still leave significant potential upside. (Here's how to find stocks near potential buy points.)

So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (also called technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.

Chart Patterns: Cup With Handle

From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.

The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% to 30%.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with the first down week).

Handle: at least five days long (count starts with first down day).

Buy point: peak in the handle, plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).

The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.

Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.

On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.

Nvidia Breakout From Cup With Handle

When Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.

The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.

Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.

From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose 750% over the next 29 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.

Showing reslienced and resumed market leadership, NVDA stock has reboounded from a sell-off that began in October 2018 and is now back to trading near an all-time high.

Chart Patterns: Double Bottom

The double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.

Here's what to look for in a double bottom:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 40% or less.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with first down week).

Peak in middle of W: should form in the upper half of the base and should be below the left-side peak.

Undercut: the bottom of second leg down should be lower than the bottom of the first leg down.

Buy point: 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.

Facebook Breakout From Double Bottom

Like many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.

Chart Patterns: Flat Base

As the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.

Here are the key elements of a flat base:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% or less.

Base length: at least five weeks (starting with the first down week).

Buy point: the peak in the base (typically on the left side of the pattern), plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Netflix Breakout From Flat Base

Netflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.

After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has stung the online ad sales of nearly every big industry player, some of them are holding up a lot better than others.

Here’s an overview of what Alphabet/Google (GOOG) - Get Report, Facebook (FB) - Get Report, Amazon.com (AMZN) - Get Report, Twitter (TWTR) - Get Report, Snap (SNAP) - Get Report and Pinterest (PINS) - Get Report have shared about their March and April ad sales trends over the last couple of weeks, via their earnings reports and calls.

Alphabet/Google

On Alphabet’s April 28 Q1 call, CFO Ruth Porat disclosed that her company’s “Google Search & other” revenue, which is dominated by search ad sales, was declining at a mid-teens annual rate at the end of March. For comparison, the segment’s revenue was up 9% over the whole of Q1, and 17% in Q4.

However -- in comments that gave Alphabet’s shares a boost -- Porat did add that Alphabet hasn’t “seen further deterioration” in its Google Search & Other growth rate in April.

YouTube ad revenue, which grew 33% over the whole of Q1, was said to be growing at a high-single digit clip at the end of March. Porat added that YouTube’s direct response ad sales, which involve ads meant to do things such as drive e-commerce transactions and app downloads, have remained strong in April, while its brand ad sales have “seen a continued decline.”

Google Network ad revenue, which involves ad sales on non-Google websites and apps, and carriers relatively low margins, was up 4% in Q1. Porat said Network revenue was declining at a low-double digit rate at the end of March.

Though they didn’t do anything to keep Alphabet’s shares from rising sharply the next day, Porat did attach some qualifiers to her April commentary.

“[A] few weeks obviously is not a quarter,” she said. “And given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter.”

Facebook

Facebook’s ad revenue rose 17% annually in Q1, after growing 25% in Q4. Mark Zuckerberg’s firm indicated that ad sales fell sharply in March, but added that it has “seen signs of stability” in April, with ad revenue roughly flat on an annual basis during the first three weeks of the month.

With Facebook’s traffic up and its ad demand down, the company’s ad impressions rose 39% annually in Q1, while its average price per ad fell 16%. For comparison, impressions were up 31% in Q4, and price per ad down 5%.

CFO Dave Wehner did caution on Facebook’s April 29 call that current Q2 GDP forecasts raise the possibility that there could be “an even more severe advertising industry contraction” than what Facebook had seen to date.

Amazon.com

Amazon’s “Other” revenue, the lion’s share of which consists of ad sales, grew 44% annually in Q1, an improvement from Q4’s 41% growth.

With a large portion of Amazon’s ad business involving product listings by Amazon marketplace sellers, the company’s ad sales are poised to hold up relatively well, even if they’re not completely immune to industry pressures.

“[We] did start to see some impact in March, some pull-back from advertisers and some downward pressure on price,” said CFO Brian Olsavsky on Amazon’s April 30 call. “But advertisers continue to advertise at a high clip. It wasn't as noticeable as maybe what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site.”

Twitter

Twitter, which had been dealing with ad product and targeting challenges prior to March, reported that its ad sales rose fractionally in Q1. However, the company added that from March 11 to March 31, its ad revenue was down 27% annually.

Moreover, on Twitter’s April 30 call, CFO Ned Segal declined on multiple occasions to provide an April revenue growth number. Rather, he only said that Twitter’s performance from March 11 to March 31 provides “a good sense to what it's been like for us.”

Snap

The Snapchat parent’s revenue, nearly all of which comes from ad sales, rose 44% annually in Q1, matching Q4’s growth rate.

On Snap’s April 21 call, CFO Derek Anderson said that Snap’s revenue was up about 58% in January and February, and about 25% in March. He added that Snap estimates its Q2 revenue growth was 15% as of April 19, and 11% during its most recent week.

Pinterest

In line with the guidance shared in an April 7 pre-announcement, Pinterest reported on Tuesday that its revenue rose 35% annually in Q1, after growing 46% in Q4. U.S. revenue rose 27%, while international revenue (still just 13% of total revenue) rose 136%.

However, in remarks that have contributed to a 13% Wednesday drop for Pinterest’s stock, CFO Todd Morgenfeld said that Pinterest’s April revenue -- though reflecting “stabilization” in its ad business following a “sharp deceleration” in late March -- fell 8% annually. He added that the decline would have been around 6% or 7% if not for a change in the Easter holiday’s timing.

The original Connected model was launched in 2015, the same year as the Apple Watch and two years before Mr Arnault joined Tag Heuer, at the age of 22. His appointment was anything but coincidental. Mr Arnault’s father, Bernard, the world’s third-richest person, sits at the top of the LVMH empire of which Tag is a part.

Governments come and go but the Arnault dynasty — which controls the world’s largest luxury group — permeates French public life. Frederic is the latest of Bernard’s heirs to take up a role inside LVMH and is now Tag’s strategy and digital director.

So what can Tag Heuer’s 75,000 or so third-generation smartwatches bring to a sector where Apple has sold 31m of its watches? “Like in every market, there is always room for competition,” says the younger Mr Arnault. “We wanted to design and build a real watch, that feels like a watch made by a watchmaker.” He cites the screwed back of the watch, which allows a battery change and gives extended life.

We wanted to design and build a real watch, that feels like a watch made by a watchmaker

As well as Tag Heuer’s staff in Switzerland, Mr Arnault has a team of engineers and designers in Paris, in effect a well-resourced tech start-up of 30 people. All work on customisation of the watch’s Android operating system.

He says: “Google is opening up its system more and more to partners to customise it as much as they want.”

Mr Arnault was also involved in bringing Tag Heuer Golf to the Connected watch. The app, which has 3D renderings of more than 39,000 golf courses, is also listed in the Apple Watch app store, where 100,000 users have signed up.

It is, however, the potential return on investment that he says makes the smartwatch sector so attractive. “The ROI on this project comes relatively soon: the dynamics are impressive — today it’s between 30 and 40 per cent [growth] in the smartwatch market year-on-year, although this year might be different because of the coronavirus.”

Mr Arnault says a quarter of 15 to 35-year-olds in the US wear smartwatches — a high penetration rate. His targets for the new Connected watch are customers who have yet to own a Tag Heuer and even those who have never owned a mechanical watch.

He says: “We see this as a point of entry into the mechanical watch world. A high percentage of Connected watch owners [say] they would be interested in two to three years to purchase a mechanical watch from Tag Heuer.”

Mr Arnault says the value of the Connected watch is in its mix “between heritage and avant-garde” — which was what attracted him to working at Tag Heuer. He asks: “How do we really respect the heritage and continue building on what made the brand? How do we make it modern and contemporary and not old-fashioned?”

The core business remains mechanical and he speaks warmly of the Heuer 02 movement combining quality and durability with ease of maintenance and an 80-hour power reserve. “We also have developments in the pipeline such as the carbon hairspring,” he says, referring to the component at the heart of mechanical watches.

Mr Arnault is keen to learn from others and Tag Heuer has poached high-profile figures from rivals. One is Edouard Mignon, who previously worked for Richemont’s watch innovation lab. Mr Arnault has also convinced Carole Forestier-Kasapi, Cartier’s highly-respected movement designer, to join Tag’s product team.

Beyond the launch of the Connected watch and its variants, Mr Arnault’s preoccupation is similar to the rest of the world: the effect of the coronavirus pandemic. “We were looking forward to this year’s Baselworld [show],” he says. “We believe that it is good for the industry to come together — the retailers, the journalists, the ecosystem around watches.”

He is uncertain about the future of LVMH’s Dubai watch event, the first of which happened in January. “Nothing has been decided. This year [the Watches & Wonders show] moved its date further into the year. It left a huge gap in January and so that was the opportunity to do LVMH Watch Week. Now of course, it is a different story.” With LVMH now having withdrawn from future Baselworld shows, Mr Arnault says the business is in discussions regarding exhibiting at next year’s Watches & Wonders.

If it does, it is likely that Mr Arnault’s youngest brother Jean — who is about to start a business degree at MIT — will be there, as he is already on an internship at Tag Heuer.

Mr Arnault says Jean has also developed an interest in watches: “He looks at blogs, follows all the auctions, loves vintage pieces and it is really great to share this passion with him.”

Given the intense scrutiny of the Arnault family, the younger members’ horological interest is fascinating.

While fashion is king at LVMH — Dior is perceived to be a cross between a religion and a French national monument for their father Bernard — taking an interest in all things horological may be an indication that timepieces look set to assume greater importance within the empire."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-caps-opportunities-amid-shifts-due-to-pandemic-194931756.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T19:49:31+00:00,"Shifts in how people consume, shop and travel due to COVID-19 could benefit small cap companies, says one market expert.

“It’s been the small caps that actually outperformed percentage wise last week, and a big part of the reason is that there are a bunch of stocks in that area that are really, I think going to be the ones to look at as we see this seismic shift that's happened because of the pandemic,” says Michele Schneider, MarketGauge director of trading education and research, told Yahoo Finance.

Schneider says small cap companies with strong earnings and good financials can “fill the void” in a behavioral shift that’s happening as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Which would be where the change is in technology, where the change is in everything that we do,” said Schneider. “How we consume, how we shop, how we go to restaurants, go to the movies, how we travel.”

“Some of the classic stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), et cetera, they're kind of almost pre-historic in a way in that they are saturated mathematically. You wonder how much more they have to go,” she added.

Schneider is also bullish on silver [SI=F], gold [GC=F] and other commodities, given the risk of stagflation in the future.

“We haven't quite gotten there yet [stagflation], but I do believe very strongly that that's a distinct possibility going forward,” said Schneider. “I'm looking at it more end of this year, maybe into 2021. We already started accumulating positions for that.”

Stagflation is commonly defined as persistent high inflation along with high unemployment and a stagnant economy. The term became popular in the U.S. during the 1970s when oil prices surged during rampant inflation and high unemployment.

Schneider notes similarities between both periods, with the exception of oil prices.

“I do believe that we're in a situation where we can keep the recessionary environment, and see these agriculturals — we're already seeing reflected a bit in gold and the miners — start going up,” said Schneider.

Gold exchange-traded funds have attracted $14.5 billion in less than five months, according to Bloomberg data. The 2020 inflows into ETF’s tracking gold surpass any full year on record, even as stocks have rallied since their March 52-week lows.

Companies have moved away from brick and mortar to predominantly online services as a result of ubiquitous Internet access. In this shift, online companies reduce overhead costs, including rent and wages, associated with operating a physical store.

While online retailers are more convenient, purchases of goods and services are subject to additional shipping and handling charges incurred by the consumer. Even though technology has transformed a number of industries over the past 10 years, shipping and postage have remained relatively unchanged. Traditional postal service providers such as USPS, UPS (UPS), and FedEx (FDX) have remained the primary source of shipping and handling for major online retailers.

Recently, Amazon (AMZN) has challenged the status quo with Amazon Prime Air. Amazon Prime Air is a drone delivery system that anticipates package deliveries in 30 minutes or less. The program has not been executed as yet but is currently in development.

While the financial and economic impact of drones is robust, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) regulations in conjunction with privacy and safety concerns have delayed the launch of commercial drone services.

Regulations

Amazon’s efforts to launch unmanned aerial delivery systems have been delayed as a result of FAA regulations. Currently, drones in the U.S. are sanctioned for military, research, and recreational use. Military drones are not subject to the same regulations as those used for research and recreation.

At the moment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the U.S. are regulated up to a height of 400 feet of airspace in populated areas. Commercial use of drones has not been sanctioned by the FAA and is currently illegal. With concerns about air space and ground safety, the FAA is reluctant to provide licenses allowing companies to test drone services within the United States.

Amazon’s inability to research aerial delivery within U.S. borders has led the ecommerce leader to test this new technology in the United Kingdom, with successful tests run in Cambridge, England, in 2016. In 2015, the FAA did provide Amazon with permission to test current models of drones, but by then Amazon had also been testing in Canada.

One of the main setbacks to drone use for commercial activity is the FAA's rule requiring ""line of sight."" This rule requires a drone operator to have the drone in their line of sight at all times, which defeats the purpose of using drones commercially, especially for deliveries.

Economic Impact

Rapid technological innovation has provided consumers cutting-edge products at affordable prices. Traditionally, drones had been limited to military use due to high costs and technical sophistication. However, due to economies of scale, consumers can purchase drones for less than $100.

With widespread access, consumer companies such as Amazon have explored the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes. Amazon Prime Air has promised a 30-minute delivery service for packages of up to 5 lbs. Google (GOOG), in altruistic contrast to Amazon, has developed aerial drones for environmental conservation and delivery of medicine to remote locations.

The environmental impact is also immense. Powered by batteries, drones are more environmentally friendly than delivery trucks. If delivery drones gain widespread usage, this would reduce the reliance on vehicles for many companies. This would have an adverse impact on automobile manufacturers, but the impact on the environment would be a boon and would help many countries reduce emissions, helping meet emissions targets set in various global agreements.

The economic implications of commercial drone use are undeniable. The market for drones is estimated to be $127 billion across a variety of industries. Notably, the commercial use of drones will predominantly affect agriculture and infrastructure more so than commerce. Due to the ability to cover large areas, drone use in agriculture is anticipated to effectively feed and hydrate plants while also limiting exposure to diseases.

On a macroeconomic scale, the integration of UAVs could create more than 100,000 jobs. Over a 10-year span, job creation from commercial drone use will consist primarily of manufacturing jobs and drone operators. Likewise, states will benefit from tax windfalls, stemming from increased economic activity.

The implications clearly have a positive impact on businesses and consumers. Consumers directly benefit from job creation, resulting in additional earnings. Commercial drones will also allow industries to realize savings from cost-effective means of inventory, transportation, and distribution. These cost savings can be passed down to the consumer through a reduction in prices.

Disadvantages

While the financial implications of drone use are robust, numerous consumers, states, and regulators believe sanctioned UAV use to be detrimental. 44 states have passed their own laws on drone usage for commercial, recreational, and public use. Widespread use of drones is anticipated to increase privacy concerns among citizens nervous about corporate and government data collection. Amazon drones utilize a camera and GPS to navigate delivery destinations, which many believe to be intrusive.

Furthermore, drone delivery services offered by Amazon and other companies will face logistical roadblocks. Traditional postal services maintain the liability of damaged or stolen property incurred in the delivery process. However, without human monitoring, a drone is unable to ensure seamless deliveries. Likewise, deliveries in major cities are bound to encounter numerous issues. Accessing apartment units within city skyscrapers is an insurmountable feat for an unmanned aerial vehicle.

Aside from logistical and privacy concerns, wildlife, such as birds, face higher risks with the greater number of aerial vehicles. The FAA estimates that birds cause more than $1 billion in damages to aircraft in the United States.

The Bottom Line

Amazon’s continued efforts to test and research unmanned aerial vehicles have put pressure on Congress and the FAA to reform drone regulations. The integration of drones into national airspace will not only benefit ecommerce businesses like Amazon but industries such as agriculture, public safety, and natural disaster management, to name a few. In a more altruistic manner, Google anticipates the use of its drones for the delivery of medical products and as a means of protecting the environment."

Some apps help people manage their finances, and some provide up-to-the-minute news of the world. Others act as a GPS, allow users to shop at their favorite stores from their phones, take pictures, send messages around the world, find somebody to date within a five-block radius, or find the best nearby bar or restaurant. Whatever you can imagine, there is probably an app for that.

Apps of all kinds have become ubiquitous, and the majority of mobile device owners use multiple apps daily. Some apps have become hugely popular, leading to success and wealth for the developers, bringing in millions or even billions of dollars. These success stories, however, are the exception, not the rule.

Key Takeaways Most app developers work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by.

Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019, though a huge majority of that revenue went to large tech companies.

While some do strike it rich, an average hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes.

The unfortunate truth is that most app developers will work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by in a world of ever-increasing competition and consumers with short attention spans.

Understanding Getting Rich Creating Apps

Some free apps generate revenue via in-app purchases or advertising, while others are purchased. The good news for both kinds of apps is that people use them a whole lot. ComScore's Global State of Mobile 2019 found that more than seven out of every eight minutes spent on mobile devices is app-related.

The bad news is that ComScore also found the majority of mobile device users download no new apps each month. There is, however, a small set of around 7% of smartphone users who download apps like crazy, accounting for nearly half of all monthly downloads.

Apps can be a huge source of profits. Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019. These days, there are tens of thousands of developers working independently, with start-ups, or with established companies to come up with the next big app.

The competition to develop a successful app is fierce, and there's no guarantee that even a great idea executed well will catch on and bring financial success. Even though some apps have made millionaires out of their creators, most app developers do not strike it rich, and the chances of making it big are depressingly small.

Successes

First, it is worth noting that the most popular apps—rated by unique visitors per month—are owned and operated by large technology firms like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).

There have been a few instances of small apps generating big success and making their creators exceedingly rich. Some apps have been snatched up by larger companies for huge sums of money, for example when Facebook bought Instagram, Onavo, and WhatsApp.

Square, the point of sale app, has a market cap of $32.9 billion as of mid-2020. Snapchat has a market cap of $26.15 billion. Uber and Lyft have caps of $54.6 billion and over $9.35 billion, respectively. Airbnb was worth over $38 billion at the end of 2019.

Challenges

While those valuations and sales numbers may seem encouraging, don't be fooled: the average app developer is unlikely to strike it rich. According to Forbes, the average app developer produces between three and five apps, each app bringing in an average revenue of $1,125 on Google's platform and $4,000 on Apple's.

A hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes. And that doesn't account for the money, time, and effort invested in creating those apps.

With those small revenue potentials, it is hard to build a team of developers and create advertising and marketing campaigns to increase recognition and drive downloads. There is also a huge amount of competition. For every category of app, there are numerous options to choose from, and making yours the one to gain traction can be hit or miss.

On top of all that, even with a hugely successful app, there is no guarantee that it will be able to produce a profit. It is increasingly difficult to monetize activities that many people have come to expect to be free—such as messaging, social networking, photo sharing, and cloud storage."

Intel shares are approaching a 62.23 buy point in a cup with handle.

Over the weekend, CEO Elon Musk threatened to move the company's operations out of California due to Alameda County's coronavirus shutdown order. Tesla's Fremont auto plant remains shut down.

Meanwhile, Tesla's China sales dove 64% in April vs. March, according to the China Passenger Car Association. For April, Tesla sold 3,635 cars after selling more than 10,100 in March amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Tesla shares are once again above a cup with handle's 775.05 buy point. On May 1, the stock's breakout failed after Musk tweeted the stock price was ""too high.""

Under Armour plunged after missing Q1 earnings and sales estimates early Monday. Under Armour lost 34 cents a share while sales measured $930.2 million.

Shares of the retailer tumbled more than 10% and are more than 70% off their 52-week high.

Dow Jones leader Apple stock looked to extend a five-day win streak that saw the stock moved beyond the 5% buy zone of a cup-with-handle's 288.35 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis. The 5% buy range goes up to 302.77.

Apple stock gained 1% early Monday. The iPhone maker is an IBD Leaderboard member. According to Leaderboard commentary, ""The stock broke out in soft volume but that can happen sometimes with megacaps. The relative strength line is at new highs, a plus. The base is second stage."" Apple stock has a 91 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating.

Meanwhile, tech giant Microsoft moved up 0.5% Monday morning, on pace to extend a five-day win streak. Shares are still in the buy range past a cup-with-handle's 180.10 buy point. The buy zone runs up to 189.11. Microsoft is also an IBD Leaderboard stock idea and an IBD Long-Term Leader.

Chicago, IL – May 12, 2020 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amgen AMGN, BHP Group BHP, Altria Group MO, Apple AAPL and Target TGT.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:

Top Research Reports for Amgen, BHP, Altria and Others

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amgen, BHP Group and Altria Group. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Amgen shares have been standout performers lately, both relative to the broader market as well as relative the peer group. This reflects growing sales momentum, according the Zacks analyst, for Amgen’s drugs like Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla and biosimilars will drive sales even though competition for its legacy products is steadily increasing.

Amgen beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q1. However, it expects a significant impact from coronavirus-related business disruption in Q2, which it expects will ease in the second half of 2020. Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio, which can drive long-term growth.

Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline while regularly pursuing “external opportunities” such as the acquisition of Otezla and the stake in China's BeiGene. Amgen also expects several important clinical data readouts from its innovative pipeline in 2020. However, pricing and competitive pressure are concerns.

These are tough times for BHP and other miners, as you can see from the stock's recent underperformance. But the critical factor for operators like BHP at this stage is the abilit to survive and it remains well positioned on that front. The Zacks analyst believes that BHP Group’s strong cash flow and focus on lowering debt are likely to enhance its capability.

The company maintains capital and exploration expenditure guidance below $8 billion for fiscal 2020 and $8 billion for fiscal 2021. It currently has six major projects under development in petroleum, copper, iron ore and potash. Efforts to make operations more efficient on the back of smarter technology adoption across the entire value chain will drive growth.

However, slowdown in global growth and lower commodity prices due to the coronavirus outbreak is likely to impact results. The consensus estimate for earnings for the current fiscal has undergone negative revision lately. Nevertheless, even though metal prices remain subdued in the near term, it will eventually pick up on the back of the impending demand-supply imbalance.

Altria’s shares have lost -19.1% over the past three months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s fall of -17.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that the company has been battling weak cigarette volumes due to stern regulations and consumers’ rising health awareness.

Though reported domestic cigarette shipment volumes rose in first-quarter 2020, it was hurt by the cigarette industry’s rate of decline and retail share losses. While management withdrew its 2020 earnings view due to COVID-19-related uncertainties, it continues to expect domestic cigarette industry volumes to drop in 2020.

Nonetheless, pricing strategies and solid oral tobacco products continued aiding Altria during the quarter, wherein top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. Management highlighted that it hasn’t seen any material disruptions from coronavirus and is focused on strengthening its cash position amid the crisis.

The coronavirus stock market rally has come a long way from March lows. The Nasdaq is not far from all-time highs, led by Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big techs.

X

ServiceNow stock and Microsoft stock are in buy zones now. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are setting up new entries, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are closing in on buy points.

But is the stock market rally disconnected from the grim economic reality? That may not be the right question for investors.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures sank 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.5%. In the coronavirus stock market rally, Dow Jones futures have been less volatile than during the market crash. But Dow futures can still show some notable swings.

Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 4.34 million. Covid-19 deaths are at least 292,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped 1.4 million, with deaths above 83,000. U.S. coronavirus cases in the past two days have hit their lowest levels in weeks. Coronavirus testing has increased substantially, with the share of positive tests falling. Much of the improvement in terms of new cases has come in the New York/New Jersey area.

Dr. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, cited concerns about reopening certain parts of the country. Los Angeles County extended its stay-at-home order by another three months. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials warned of business failures on a ""grand scale.""

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally pulled back, closing at session lows on some of those coronavirus shutdown headlines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.9% and the S&P 500 index 2.05%. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.1%, snapping a six-session win streak with an outside day, downside reversal.

Apple stock, a Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq component, retreated 1.1%, also breaking its six-day win streak. The relative strength line for Apple stock hit a record high.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) slid 2.6%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 2.35%. Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are big IGV holdings. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 2.75%, with Nvidia and AMD notable members

The coronavirus stock market rally arguably has been due for a pullback. But should it be a lot lower?

Stock Market Rally Disconnect From Economic Reality?

Many argue that there's a disconnect between the coronavirus stock market rally from the economic reality of a massive recession and joblessness. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and will shed millions more in May. Unemployment is expected to top 20% at a minimum. There are some positive signs while states and countries are starting to open up, but until there's a vaccine much of the economy will be in a lower gear or shut down entirely.

So is the coronavirus stock market rally divorced from reality? Let's take a closer look.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Winners

The big stock market rally winners during the coronavirus crisis aren't a surprise. Many are just outright coronavirus plays: Zoom Video (ZM), Moderna (MRNA), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Peloton Interactive (PTON), along with Netflix stock, Amazon stock and Shopify stock.

Meanwhile, AMD stock, Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock, Nvidia (NVDA), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and many others — especially software — are benefiting in various ways from the stay-at-home trend, helping people hold up or even thrive in the coronavirus crisis.

Further down, there are internet giants Facebook stock and Google stock as well as digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL). Facebook and Google are seeing strong demand from people stuck at home. PayPal is benefiting from people adopting digital payments. Facebook stock, Google stock and PayPal stock may do especially well in a world of continued social distancing but with a recovery in advertising and consumer spending.

Likewise, Apple stock and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) have broken out. Apple and Lululemon are upscale consumer discretionary companies. In the midst of a deep recession where people have been stuck at home, status-enhancing discretionary purchases would seem at risk. But, to be blunt, many people who buy Apple and Lululemon products haven't lost their well-paying jobs. If these consumers feel confident that the economy will improve, they're willing to spend today.

Also, some medicals are doing well, seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, such as Dexcom (DXCM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Finally, a few consumer products companies like Clorox (CLX) and General Mills (GIS) were plodding along before the coronavirus crisis but have seen demand spike for cleaning products, cereal and soup.

So there's a good argument for all of these stocks to be doing well. In other words, the leading stocks in the coronavirus market rally don't seem disconnected from their companies' reality.

Given the heft of Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Netflix stock, Amazon stock, Nvidia stock, AMD stock, Facebook stock, Google stock, PayPal stock, Shopify stock, ServiceNow stock, along with many other coronavirus market rally winners, it's easy to see why the Nasdaq composite is doing so well.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Losers

Meanwhile, plenty of ""real economy"" market sectors have been badly hit: travel, leisure, energy, manufacturing and many retailers and financials. Many of these sectors are shut down.

Most of these companies were struggling before the coronavirus with beaten-down stocks. The market cap on many of these stocks is fairly low. Macy's (M), the nation's largest department store chain, has a market cap of $1.55 billion. Contrast that to Microsoft stock, with a market cap of $1.38 trillion. So solid advances by megacap techs such as Microsoft, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock can offset much bigger losses by companies with lower valuations.

Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, with more ""real economy"" stocks than the Nasdaq, have made far less progress in the coronavirus stock market rally.

Keep in mind that the stock market is made up of major companies, with most ""small-cap stocks"" small relative to the giants, but still fairly substantial operations. The stock market is not a microcosm of the overall economy, with the millions of truly small businesses struggling to survive.

Yes, The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Is Surprising

All that being said, it is surprising to see the stock market rally so quickly toward highs, even setting aside the economy. The old saying is that markets fall on an elevator and rise on an escalator. But the current stock market rally has run up almost as fast as the market crash.

The fact that the U.S. economy is suffering a historic contraction amid a still active pandemic makes the pace of the stock market rally even more surprising.

Follow, Don't Fight The Stock Market

But you want to pay attention to what the stock market is doing right now. Don't try to impose your opinions on it. The stock market doesn't care what you or I think.

Perhaps the market will re-evaluate the economic and earnings outlook to the downside, via a grim economic report, big corporate warning or a spike in coronavirus cases.

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock market move sideways for several weeks or pull back, at least somewhat.

Then again, maybe the stock market rally will surge into new high ground and beyond.

No matter what happens, if you're following the coronavirus market rally via the major indexes and leading stocks, you'll be ready to move with the stock market trend. Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Top Stocks To Watch

Microsoft stock, AMD stock, ServiceNow stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is Apple stock, which is modestly extended. Meanwhile, Facebook stock, AMD stock and Apple stock are on SwingTrader.

NFLX stock, FB stock, AMD stock and NOW stock are all IBD 50 members, along with several other stock market rally winners cited above.

Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

ServiceNow Stock

ServiceNow stock fell 4.7% to 365.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading. NOW stock is still above the 363.05 cup-base buy point. A pullback toward the buy point is normal, especially with race-from-the-bottom cup patterns.

The relative strength line for ServiceNow stock is still near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ServiceNow stock can be bought now, or perhaps at 388.60, just above Monday's all-time high.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock fell 2.3% to 182.51. MSFT stock is in range from a 180.10 handle on a double-bottom base. The RS line for Microsoft stock is at record highs.

Microsoft stock has the largest valuation of any U.S.-listed company. It just edges out Apple stock, which is at $1.35 trillion. Amazon stock follows at $1.18 trillion and Google stock at $939 billion.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock sank 2% to 431.82. NFLX stock is extended from an April breakout, but has been consolidating for a few weeks. It's not long enough for a proper base, but 449.62 could serve as an entry point for Netflix stock. A stock market rally pause or pullback could offer more time for NFLX stock to form a traditional consolidation.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock sank 2.2% to 2,356.95. Like Netflix stock, AMZN stock has been consolidating for a few weeks, though the e-commerce and cloud-computing services giant popped to a record 1,475 on April 30 just before earnings. Amazon stock fell on the earnings miss and weak guidance, but has remained in its recent range. A move above the old high would offer an entry point for Amazon stock.

AMD Stock

AMD stock sank 3.55%. The chipmaker is working on a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. AMD stock recently lagged some other data-center chipmakers, such as Nvidia stock and Inphi (IPHI), but may be perking up again. AMD earnings per share surged 300% and 200% in the last two quarters.

Facebook Stock

Facebook stock dipped 1.4% to 210.10. FB stock is steadily moving toward a V-shape consolidation with a 224.30 buy point. The relative strength line for Facebook stock has ramped up sharply in the last few weeks. Facebook stock once again on Tuesday was a ""Blue Dot"" stock, signifying stocks in bases with RS lines at new highs. They are identified on MarketSmith charts with a blue-shaded dot at the end of their RS lines.

A coronavirus stock market rally pause could offer a chance for Facebook stock to build a handle.

Google Stock

Google stock fell 2% to 1,375.18. A cup base with a 1,530.84 buy point has formed for GOOGL stock. Google stock, like FANG peer Facebook's stock, is a Blue Dot special today.

With the latest investment, Jio Platforms has raised about 606 billion rupees from technology investors, the Indian company said in a statement Friday. Facebook announced buying about 10% for $5.7 billion last month, followed by a $753 million investment by Silver Lake Partners a few days later.

“We are excited to leverage the professional expertise and multi-level support that Vista has been offering to its investments globally for the benefit of Jio,” Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said in the statement.

The Indian billionaire, Asia’s richest person, has been announcing a string of fund-raising plans as part of a proposal to slash debt at his Mumbai-based conglomerate and also to bolster investor confidence following the pandemic-led crash in crude oil prices. Last month, Reliance Industries said that the group’s net debt would be slashed to zero ahead of its previous target of early 2021.

The Webinar will feature Brian Estes, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner at Off the Chain Capital, LLC, which employs a value-based approach to cryptocurrency inspired by the works of Graham and Dodd. Bitcoin has come into the spotlight recently as central banks around the world adopt zero interest rate policies and investors including Paul Tudor Jones have taken significant positions in the cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies may also disrupt legacy technology companies like Amazon.com, Inc., Facebook, Inc., Paypal Holdings, Inc., and Apple Inc. Decentralized platforms built on blockchain technology using cryptocurrency for native tokens on the internet pose a challenge such tech giants.

Mr. Estes will discuss:

Why does bitcoin have value?

What is the bitcoin halving and why is it important?

Today’s global debt crisis and how it will benefit bitcoin

Why add bitcoin to a diversified investment portfolio

Models used to determine bitcoin’s value

While most prominent tech companies are fretting about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Netflix Inc. may become even more important in the daily lives of Americans forced to stay at home and in front of their televisions.

The shelter-in-place orders across America, combined with the loss of live sports, could accelerate the adoption of the types of streaming services that Netflix NFLX, -1.97% pioneered. Early returns showed that paid subscriptions for streaming TV and video jumped 32% the week of March 16, according to Recurly Inc.

While a mass move to streaming from viewers who had held on to cable bundles could validate the years-long prophesy of Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings, there are still reasons to worry. To put a name on them, it would be Walt Disney Co. DIS, -2.97% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.14% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -2.16% , along with a few others.

Hastings has repeatedly said that competition would benefit Netflix in the long run because it moves people to stream even more, but increased competition weighed on Netflix’s forecast for the first quarter, and is especially troublesome in the U.S., where growth has been an issue. Domestic net subscriptions have declined in 10 of the past 12 quarters, based on data compiled by Antenna.

A principal cause early last year was price increases, followed by heightened competition from Disney and Apple in November. (In February, Disney reported 28.6 million subscribers of Disney+ and 30.7 million for Hulu. Apple has not disclosed Apple+ subscriber numbers.) Netflix ended 2019 with 167 million subscribers worldwide, 61 million of them in the U.S.

Two recent surveys underscore Netflix’s competitive challenge.

Disney+ and Hulu — also owned by Disney — have emerged as the most popular sercices among first-time subscribers, according to a survey of 6,809 people in the U.S. in late March by TV analytics company EDO. Since the coronavirus outbreak, 29% of new subscribers chose Disney+, followed by Hulu (21%), and Netflix (15%). Apple TV+ was picked by less than 10%.

Of those considering adding a new streaming service, Hulu, Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video emerged as the first four choices, according to a poll of 1,000 people in late March from Kagan, the media research unit within S&P Global Market Intelligence.

What differentiates Netflix, and could give it a competitive advantage, is the volume of its catalog and the fact it has completed most of its programming for the year. While others are trying to build a catalog and are coping with production shutdowns, Netflix is benefiting from the viral popularity of its documentary series “Tiger King.” The company also has lined up an array of impending releases such as “#blackAF” (April 17), a mockumentary sitcom from “Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris, and “Never Have I Ever” (April 27), a coming-of-age comedy series about an Indian-American teenage girl, inspired by producer Mindy Kaling’s childhood.

Last year, Netflix released 2,769 hours of original programming, compared with 1,537 hours in 2018, according to an Omdia report. Netflix offered 657 first-run original titles in 2019, compared with 386 in 2018.

Netflix reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 21.

How the numbers are changing

Revenue: Average analyst expectations were $5.76 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $5.74 billion as of April 6. Paid net additions of subscribers, a key indicator of Netflix’s sales, have slipped from 8.5 million to 7.42 million in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, FactSet expects revenue of $24.26 billion.

Earnings: Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $1.21 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $1.61 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $5.94 a share.

Stock movement: During the first three months of 2020, shares rose 16%, with most of the gains coming since mid-March and the cancellation of nearly all live-entertainment events because of COVID-19. Netflix was one of only 30 S&P 500 SPX, -2.05% components to gain in the first quarter.

What the company is saying

April 21: Netflix wowed Wall Street with its biggest quarter and a record number of new paid subscribers, nearly 16 million. Revenue grew to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion in the year-ago period. The news sent Netflix shares soaring 9% in extended trading.

April 15: Netflix shares ended the day at $426.75, topping the July 9, 2018, record high of $418.97 as it continues to show itself a streaming force during the outbreak.

March 22: All Netflix productions have been shut down, but the company has enough new content for the next few months, Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told CNN Business in an interview. The company established a $100 million relief fund for production crews.

March 19: Netflix said it would reduce bit rates across all of its streams in Europe, effectively cutting traffic 25%, to preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the coronavirus crisis. It did so after European Union industry chief Thierry Breton requested it to prevent overload as more consumers view content from home during the crisis. Netflix had 51.8 million subscribers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East at the end of 2019, according to FactSet.

March 2: “[W]e’re 55% penetrated, roughly, in the U.S. And if we take that out to the rest of the world and you kind of do the math on that and when it would — you know, we talk about it as the addressable market, and you’re at 400 million to 500 million-plus paying member business, which is a pretty good place to be,” Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said at a Morgan Stanley conference. “But we’re not — we’re also not conceding that we’ve hit some sort of a ceiling in the U.S.”

What analysts are saying

• “We expect the stay-at-home era to have both near-term and long-term benefits for Netflix. We expect the near-term benefits include some combination of reduced churn, increased gross adds, and higher ARPU (trade-ups to plans allowing more concurrent streams). We believe as an increasing number of people experience Netflix, at an especially high rate of usage, they will be loath to go back to life without it. The adoption of streaming will be accelerated and further ingrained into the culture.” — AB Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, maintaining an outperform rating, and raising Netflix’s price target to $487 from $423, on March 31.

• “Although hours streamed are growing during COVID-19, we prefer Roku Inc. ROKU, -3.79% , which has a volume-based revenue model (ie, advertising CPMs) based on viewing time rather than NFLX, which charges the same price regardless of hours viewed.” — Needham analyst Laura Martin, maintaining underperform rating and price target of $332.83, on March 23."

Disney stock closed little changed.

Disney Earnings Call

CFO Christine McCarthy said Disney will forgo a July dividend payment to preserve $1.6 billion of cash. The company pays a semiannual dividend of 88 cents.

New CEO Bob Chapek, who previously was in charge of the parks segment, said Shanghai Disneyland, closed since January, will reopen May 11. But it's ""too early to predict when we will begin to resume all of our operations,"" he added.

In Shanghai, masks for guests and employees, temperature checks, contact tracing and other detection methods will be used. Social distancing measures include limits on attendance and spacing on rides.

Chapek added that he's ""pleased with growth in the four weeks since"" the company announced it had 50 million Disney+ subscribers in early April. It has 54.5 million subscribers as of May 4.

Disney Earnings Plunge

For fiscal Q2, Disney earnings per share tumbled 63% to 60, missing Zacks forecast for 83 cents per share. Management estimated the coronavirus' impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes across all businesses was as much as $1.4 billion.

Revenue grew 21% to $18.01 billion, just short of views for $18.03 billion, though it got a boost from the $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox entertainment assets in March 2019.

Media networks revenue rose 28% to $7.26 billion, but advertising revenue fell due to lower average viewership. Parks revenue fell 10% to $5.54 billion, and operating income took a $1 billion hit from Covid-19. Studio revenue grew 18% to $2.54 billion.

Direct-to-consumer revenue, which includes streaming, nearly quadrupled to $4.12 billion while operating losses widened from $385 million to $812 million. Disney+ had 33.5 million subscribers on March 28, but Disney put it at 50 million global subscribers as of early April. Total Hulu subscribers rose 27% to 32.1 million by late March, and EPSN+ more than tripled to 7.9 million.

Disney+ launched in the U.S. in November and expanded across Europe in March, as the deadly virus fueled streaming demand.

Shares dipped 0.2% to 100.88 on the stock market today after trading up and down. Disney stock is trying to retake its 50-day line after plunging below that key level in February and March. The relative strength line is near multiyear lows. Among streaming rivals, Netflix rose 2.3% on Wednesday, Amazon (AMZN) added 1.4%, and Comcast (CMCSA) retreated 2.5%.

Disney+ Streaming Service

Disney earnings were uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus, as the pandemic closed theme parks, stopped cruises and delayed new movie releases. The suspension of pro sports leagues also deprived top cable asset ESPN of fresh content.

Parks were Disney's biggest profit driver in 2019, and Disney's movie studios controlled 31% of the global box office last year.

Meanwhile, stay-at-home orders have boosted demand for video streaming services like Disney+, which saw titles like ""Frozen II,"" ""Onward"" and ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" arrive on the platform months ahead of schedule.

Earlier this week, analysts at MoffettNathanson downgraded Disney stock to neutral from buy, warning that the economic hit to the company would last longer than most anticipate.

But Disney's new Netflix (NFLX) rival Disney+ has offset some challenges in other parts of the business.

Disney is targeting 60 million to 90 million Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. It also forecast profitability for the video streaming service by 2024.

The outlook for streaming profits, and Disney earnings, may have changed with Comcast's streaming release last month of ""Trolls World Tour,"" which broke digital sales records and made more money than the prior ""Trolls"" movie did in theatrical release in 2016.

Shopify earnings surged in the first quarter, sending SHOP stock to a record high. But is Shopify stock a buy right now?

X

The e-commerce platform provider helps individuals and small businesses set up shop online and build their brands. Privately held BigCommerce is a close competitor, but now Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) have set their sights on digital and online sales.

Shopify was started by snowboarding enthusiasts roughly a decade ago. In fact, it started as an online snowboard shop, moving into e-commerce software when the founders couldn't find what they were looking for — a platform to both sell goods and grow the brand.

The Canadian software company helps more than 1 million merchants across 175 countries to sell, market and manage their products. In return, it earns subscription fees. It also offers shipping, digital payments and fulfillment. In 2019, subscriptions accounted for 41% of revenue and merchant solutions for 59%.

Shopify Stock Technical Analysis

SHOP stock cleared a 593.99 buy point in strong volume April 20, according to MarketSmith analysis. On May 5, Shopify stock cleared a 665.84 alternate entry. Shopify stock is now extended from both entries after jumping May 6 on a big earnings beat Wednesday.

The relative strength line is making new highs along with the stock, a positive sign. The RS line, which measures Shopify stock's performance against the S&P 500, is the blue line in the chart shown.

In April, Shopify stock soared 52% as management said it ""won't be long before traffic has doubled or more.""

Shopify earns an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99. The rating combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single score.

The software stock was a huge winner in 2019 and continues to outperform, giving it a near-perfect 98 RS Rating. Shares kept moving higher during last year's stock market pullbacks, an especially bullish sign given the massive run-up in price since 2017.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A reflects heavy buying by institutions in the past 13 weeks. SHOP stock is well traded, with roughly 3.5 million shares bought and sold on average every day.

Shopify stock debuted five years ago and has solid institutional backing: 1,179 funds owned the stock as of March, up from 1,144 in December.

SHOP Earnings And Fundamentals

On key earnings and sales metrics, Shopify stock earns a poor EPS Rating of 33 out of 99, and an SMR Rating of C, on a scale of A-E, with A the best. The EPS rating reflects a company's health on fundamental earnings, and its SMR Rating measures sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.

The EPS Rating is low because the company doesn't have a long earnings history, and reported a surprise Q3 2019 loss.

On May 6, the e-commerce software leader posted a surprise profit for the first quarter. Shopify earnings soared 217% to 19 cents a share. Revenue rose 47% to $470 million. The key metric of gross merchandise volume, or the value of all goods sold on the Shopify platform, jumped 46% to $17.4 billion, topping estimates of $16.83 billion.

The sales surge cemented views that brick-and-mortar businesses are pivoting online, boosting Shopify stock.

The company pulled 2020 guidance April 1 on coronavirus uncertainty. It did not update Wednesday, merely saying it is closely monitoring the situation.

For all of 2020, analysts on average expected Shopify earnings per share to crumble 93% to 2 cents, but that was before the surprise Q1 profit. Sales are seen growing 29% to $2.04 billion for the year. Shopify is investing heavily to grow its fulfillment business. In 2021, Shopify earnings per share is seen up more than 2,000% to 44 cents, with revenue up 33% to $2.72 billion.

But, with the coronavirus crisis, take all earnings estimates with a huge grain of salt.

Over the past three years, Shopify grew earnings at a 54% annual rate and sales by 59%. It saw an adjusted annual profit for the first time in 2017.

The hot software stock lags several peers with its 5.1% pretax profit margin, the IBD Stock Checkup tool shows. Its 2% return on equity is well under the minimum 17% or higher that investors would want to see.

Coronavirus Impact On Shopify

Discussing the coronavirus impact on its business Wednesday, Shopify signaled it's largely positive.

While the pandemic has curbed global commerce and especially strained smaller businesses, it has sped up the shift to online shopping, according to the company.

""We are working as fast as we can to support our merchants by retooling our products to help them adapt to this new reality,"" CEO Tobi Lutke said in the earnings release.

Shopify added it's ""uniquely positioned to help businesses,"" enabling entrepreneurs to start online businesses.

New initiatives include extended 90-day free trials for plan sign-ups. They also include local in-store or curbside pickup and delivery.

More recently, Shopify launched Shop, a new mobile shopping app. The Shop app allows users to discover local businesses, get product recommendations from their favorite brands and track all of their online orders.

But in March and April, Shopify saw more merchants downgrade to lower-priced plans than in the prior two months.

Given coronavirus uncertainty, Shopify's watching how rising joblessness impacts both shop creation on its platform and consumer spending.

Amazon, EBay Rival?

Shopify is seen as a growing challenger to the e-commerce dominance of Amazon. But Shopify is not itself a retailer; rather, it helps its mostly small and midsize customers compete against larger businesses. They use Shopify's tools to build websites, list products and collect payments, all under their own domain name and brand.

The company had several notable achievements in Q1. Among the highlights:

It continued to develop the Shopify Fulfillment Network. The company is spending $1 billion over five years to build the fulfillment business. Shopify could break even on the effort by 2023, analysts say.

Shopify enhanced fulfillment solutions from its 6 River Systems acquisition. That included upgrades to its mobile robot, called Chuck.

It grew Shopify Shipping, a service that allows merchants to print labels to fulfill online orders.

In 2019, Shopify expanded Shopify Marketing, as Adobe (ADBE) beefs up its digital marketing business with acquisitions. It added 13 languages, including Chinese and Hindi, to the Shopify platform, taking the total to 20. Some 29% of its merchants are now from non-English-speaking markets.

Analysts say Shopify could triple its market share to 9% within five years, eventually rivaling Amazon's first-party sales. Shopify is investing heavily both at home and overseas to build awareness about its brand.

But Microsoft has launched its own e-commerce software tools for businesses. Longtime partner Facebook now also has a shopping feature for the photo-sharing app Instagram.

SHOP Stock Group

Shopify belongs to IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 5 out of 197 industry groups. Shopify stock itself ranks No. 14 out of 69 stocks in this group.

Paycom Software (PAYC), ServiceNow (NOW), DocuSign (DOCU) and Zoom Video (ZM) are other top stocks in this group.

ServiceNow is on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks.

Is Shopify Stock A Buy Right Now?

Shopify ticks off many of the boxes that investors should be looking for. SHOP stock was a big winner in 2019 and again in the coronavirus market rally. Key acquisitions and expansions promise more runway for growth.

This software company doesn't have a long earnings history and is poised for earnings pain in the near term, but it delivered a big Q1 surprise. Longer term, analysts are betting on big Shopify earnings growth.

From a technical view, Shopify stock been acting bullishly in the coronavirus stock market. But SHOP stock is extended, meaning shares are not in a proper buy zone. Investors could wait for Shopify to form a new base, or pull back to the 50-day line.

Bottom line: Shopify stock is not a buy right now. But it's definitely one to watch.

Other large-cap stocks to buy right now may also offer proper breakouts as well as the potential for solid rewards.

Millionaires are popping up in America like weeds. Indeed, the U.S. hasn't seen such a torrid increase in the ranks of millionaires in more than a decade.

They can thank record levels for stock prices.

""The 7% rise in millionaire households in 2018 is the strongest rate of growth in that market since the financial downturn 10 years ago,"" says David M. Thompson, managing director at Phoenix Marketing International, which tracks the affluent market. ""The growth in capital markets in 2018 clearly lifted many more households into the millionaire ranks.""

Total households in the U.S. with at least $1 million in investable assets have increased by 534,000 in the past 12 months, Thompson notes. In the past decade since the financial crisis, the number of millionaire households has grown by more than 2 million.

As a result, 6.21%, or 7,698,765 U.S. households out of 123,942,960 total households, can now claim millionaire status. That's up from only 5.8% a year ago. To reach that lofty level, you must have investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding the value of real estate, employer-sponsored retirement plans and business partnerships.

When imagining where America's millionaires live, most people probably think of California and New York. But although those states have their fair share of millionaires in terms of raw numbers, they don't have the highest concentrations of rich households. It turns out there are numerous states with higher percentages of well-off households than New York or California, several of which probably will surprise you. And don't forget that between living costs and taxes, a million dollars goes much further in some states than others.

Here's a look at the millionaire ratings for all 50 states (and the District of Columbia), based on the percentage of millionaire households in each. Just for good measure, we're also providing important tax and cost-of-living information.

Millionaire households: 41,685

Total households: 1,133,149

Concentration of millionaires: 3.68%

Median income for all households: $42,009 (U.S. median: $57,652)

Median home value: $109,300 (U.S. median: $193,500)

Mississippi might have the lowest concentration of millionaire households per capita in the U.S., but it also has the lowest overall cost of living in the U.S. It's almost 19% cheaper to live in the Magnolia State vs. the national average, according to the Council for Community and Economic Research (C2ER). That means a million bucks goes further than it does elsewhere. Just have a look at Tupelo and Hattiesburg, which rank among the cheapest cities in the U.S.

Mississippi also has some of the lowest taxes. Indeed, it's one of Kiplinger's 10 most tax-friendly states in the U.S., thanks to relatively light property and gas taxes.

Millionaire households: 29,031

Total households: 756,671

Concentration of millionaires: 3.84%

Median income for all households: $44,061

Median home value: $111,600

West Virginia has a relatively low concentration of millionaires, but its median real estate taxes are among the lowest in the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation. The Mountain State's sales taxes are reasonable, too. Like many western states, West Virginia benefits from natural resources such as gas and coal, and collects significant severance taxes from them.

But be forewarned: The state is not particularly tax-friendly for retirees.

A plus for West Virginia residents is that the cost of living is 9.9% lower than the national average, according to the C2ER.

Arkansas might not be bristling with millionaires, but it has some of the lowest living costs in the U.S., which are 15% below the national average. Heck, the cities of Jonesboro and Conway are two of the least expensive places to live in the entire country.

When it comes to taxes, Arkansas is more of a mixed bag. Property taxes are low in the Natural State, but sales taxes are the third-highest in the country -- even groceries are taxed (albeit at a lower rate). And income tax is particularly complicated in Arkansas.

Millionaire households: 77,671

Total households: 1,772,382

Kentucky has fewer than 80,000 millionaire households. But then, with a cost of living 12.3% below the national average, paychecks tend to go further. Groceries run about 10% below the U.S. average, while housing is roughly a fifth less expensive.

The tax situation for all Kentucky residents is mixed. Sales taxes are modest and the property tax burden is light. However, effective income tax rates can be high even for relatively low earners.

For retirees, however, Kentucky is decidedly tax-friendly. The Bluegrass State exempts Social Security benefits from state income taxes, as well as up to $31,110 per person of a wide variety of retirement income.

The vast expanse of the Gem State claims only 639,110 households, of which fewer than 30,000 can be considered millionaires. A high concentration of them live in the part of the greater Jackson, Wyoming, area that spills into Idaho.

Happily, for rich and not-so-rich alike, Idaho's overall cost of living is 11.7% below the national average.

Somewhat less upbeat is Idaho's tax picture, which is mixed. Idaho took steps to head off an effective state tax increase from the new Federal tax law. Even so, Idaho's top tax rate of 6.925% kicks in at a fairly low bracket ($22,558 for married joint filers), making its income-tax hit feel more like that of a coastal state.

Alabama is another state where you don't need a million bucks to live well. Although only 4.55% of its 1.9 million households hit the millionaire threshold, some of the lowest housing costs in the country help spread the wealth. Overall, the cost of living in the Yellowhammer State is 13.4% below the national average.

It also helps that Alabama is one of the more tax-friendly states. Property taxes are the second-lowest in the country, but sales taxes take a bite -- and the full rate is levied on food.

It also helps that Alabama allows you to deduct your federal income taxes (it's one of just of a handful of states with this break). The state also is among the most tax-friendly for retirees.

New Mexico is somewhat of a strange bird when it comes to millionaires. Los Alamos, New Mexico, sounds like an unlikely place to find a lot of millionaires, but at 11.6%, it actually has the highest concentration of millionaire households of any small town in the U.S.

Outside of Los Alamos, the state has a more typical concentration of affluence, with fewer than 1 in 20 households claiming investable assets of $1 million or more. That helps keep a lid on living costs, which are 7.2% below the U.S. average.

Unfortunately for residents of all means, the Land of Enchantment isn't particularly tax-friendly -- or a friendly state for retirement. Social Security benefits are subject to tax by the state, as are retirement account distributions and pension payouts.

The energy industry is a cornerstone of Oklahoma's wealth, so it should come as no surprise that fuel taxes are low. Less appealing? An income-tax structure that puts many people into the highest bracket. Oklahoma also has the sixth-highest combined sales tax rate in the nation.

However, you don't need to be a millionaire to live well in the Sooner State. Not only does Oklahoma offer a cost of living that's more than 13% below the national average, but its largest city offers remarkably affordable prices for its size.

Oklahoma City, a metro area with about 1.4 million people, offers a lot of big-city attractions, from a philharmonic orchestra to the National Softball Hall of Fame and Museum to the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder. And yet it remains one of the cheapest large U.S. cities in which to live.

A million dollars sure goes far in some parts of Indiana. Richmond, Ind., where the cost of living runs 21% below the U.S. average, happens to be the cheapest small town in America. The cost of living in Indiana is 12.3% below the national average.

Although living costs are low, Indiana isn't a great state for retirees. Indeed, it's one of Kiplinger's least tax-friendly states for retirees. While the state exempts Social Security benefits and offers limited exemptions for military pensions and federal civil-service pensions, IRAs, 401(k) plans and private pensions are fully taxable. And counties have the authority to levy their own income taxes on top of the state's flat tax.

A good deal of Montana's wealth stems from its abundance of natural resources. Agriculture, oil, copper and timber all play an important role in the economy, to say nothing of travel and tourism. Nearly 5%, or more than 21,000 households, can claim millionaire status. And a dollar tends to go father in the Treasure State. Montana's cost of living is 7.1% lower than the national average.

The good news for citizens across the income spectrum is that Montana has no general state sales tax. The bad news is that the top income rate of 6.9% kicks in at just $17,900 of taxable income, and Montana taxes virtually all forms of retirement income, including Social Security.

Whether you're still working or a retiree, Big Sky Country isn't the most tax-friendly place to live.

From Hilton Head Island to the Midlands region to the Blue Ridge Mountains, South Carolina has something for everyone -- but you don't have to be a millionaire to enjoy its many pleasures. Relatively low prices for housing and transportation help keep the Palmetto State's cost of living under control. According to the C2ER, South Carolina is 7.1% cheaper than the national average.

Although South Carolina boasts the seventh-lowest property taxes in the country, many taxpayers find themselves in the highest income bracket. That's because the top 7% rate kicks in at just $14,600 of income.

Tennessee is known for country music, BBQ and bourbon more than an abundance of millionaires, but the state should get more recognition for its affordability. Indeed, Memphis and Knoxville are two of the least expensive cities in the U.S., and more broadly, the state's cost of living is 13.2% below the national average.

Tennesseans also tend to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. The Volunteer State has no broad-based income tax and is phasing out its tax on stock dividends and interest income.

Agriculture, the petroleum industry, shipping and tourism are staples of the economy of Louisiana, helping to create almost 90,000 millionaire households.

Folks who call the Pelican State home enjoy a cost of living that 10.2% below the national average. They also benefit from property taxes among the lowest in the country, which help's make Louisiana one of Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states.

Almost 5% of Missouri's households have at least $1 million in investable assets, but there's nothing elite about that level when it comes to paying taxes. Missouri took steps in 2018 to reduce its income tax bite, which has historically been a big one, with most taxpayers hit by its top marginal rate (5.9% for 2018). That rate drops to 5.4% in 2019.

Helpfully, the cost of living in Missouri is 14.3% lower than the national average. Housing is particularly affordable, running 27% below the rest of the U.S. In a notable downside for both retirees of all means: Missouri ranks 42nd in the nation for senior health.

North Carolina has a lot going for it whether you're a millionaire or not. It's 11.7% less expensive to live in the Tar Heel State than the national average, and Durham is one of the happiest places to retire in the U.S., according to the according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index.

Taxes are another plus. The state has been shaking up its tax structure, switching out graduated income tax brackets for a flat tax and capturing more services with its sales tax. The tax rate for 2018 was 5.49%; this year, it has dropped to 5.25%

South Dakota is better known for Mount Rushmore, agriculture and the great outdoors than millionaires, but more than 1 in 20 households have at least $1 million in investable assets.

It also happens to be a great place to retire.

Affordability is the main factor. The cost of living is 9.4% below the national average. It's also one of the most tax-friendly states. And since South Dakota ranks second in the U.S. for fiscal soundness, according to a recent report from George Mason University's Mercatus Center, you can have high confidence that it can keep up with short-term expenses and long-term financial obligations.

If you need proof that the house always wins, just take a look at Nevada. Median income for all households is slightly below the U.S. average. Meanwhile, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) CEO Sheldon Adelson -- the state's richest person -- has a net worth of $36.2 billion.

But you don't have to go to Las Vegas to rub elbows with the Silver State's millionaires. Gardnerville Ranchos and Elko, Nevada, are among the top 20 small towns with the highest concentration of millionaires in the U.S.

The cost of living in Nevada is essentially on par with the national average, but residents catch a break on taxes. As a no-income-tax haven, Nevada is one of Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states.

There are fewer than 30,000 millionaire households in Maine -- a state in which rich and poor alike face relatively high living costs and taxes. Expenses in the Pine Tree State run 9.5% above the national average. Residents pay more for groceries, housing and utilities, in particular.

Although it has been working to lower its income taxes, Maine's lowest rate still is higher than some other states' maximum rate. Indeed, the Pine Tree State is one of Kiplinger's least tax-friendly states.

NBA superstar LeBron James might have forsaken the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers, but the great state of Ohio has plenty of other millionaires to fill his sizable shoes. Nearly a quarter of a million households -- out of 4.7 million total -- have at least $1 million in investable assets in the Buckeye State.

Although Ohio can't compete with L.A. for glamour, LBJ may miss Ohio's affordability and comparatively lighter tax bite. The cost of living in Ohio is 14% below the national average. (Los Angeles happens to be the ninth most expensive city in the U.S.)

And although Ohio isn't exactly tax-friendly, no state goes after big earners quite like the Golden State.

The farming and food-processing powerhouse of a state has a relatively low cost of living, but it can be tough on residents' wallets when it comes to paying taxes.

Iowa has a top tax bracket of 8.53% and brings it to bear on a relatively low level of taxable income, giving the Hawkeye State an income-tax bite that exceeds many East Coast states. Nor does Iowa go easy on retirees.

Easing the sting a bit is a cost-of-living index that's 11.9% lower than the U.S. average.

Bucolic Wisconsin's 124,968 millionaire households enjoy a relatively affordable cost of living, but taxes in the Badger State can be a bit of a burden.

Wisconsin recently lowered income tax rates and reduced the number of brackets. But many residents of the Badger State will find themselves in the 6.27% bracket, which kicks in on income above only $22,900 for singles and $30,540 for joint filers. At the same time, property taxes are high.

On the other hand, it's 7.3% cheaper to live in Wisconsin than the country as a whole.

When it comes to the well off and Nebraska, one name immediately comes to mind: Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), is the Cornhusker State's richest -- and most famous -- resident. But while the Oracle of Omaha is clearly in a league if his own, Nebraska does have 40,549 other households with at least a million bucks in investable assets.

The cost of living in Nebraska is 10% lower than the national average, according to Council for Community and Economic Research.

When it comes to paying taxes, Nebraska is ranked as ""not tax-friendly"" by Kiplinger. True, the state has been making efforts to reduce its income tax bite, including creating a personal exemption credit in 2018 so that the new federal tax law wouldn't raise individuals' state taxes. But property taxes are the among the highest in the country.

Like Florida, Arizona is a retirement haven and one of Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states for millionaires and non-millionaires alike. While the Grand Canyon State does have an income tax, the rates are notably low. If you're a joint filer, you won't hit the top bracket until your income is over $300,000. Sales taxes lean high, though, and some cities tax groceries.

Helpfully, Arizona is not quite as inexpensive as Florida. The cost of living in the state is equal to the national average.

Michigan doesn't have the highest concentration of millionaires in the country, but it is among the top states for billionaires. According to Forbes, the Great Lakes State claims 11 billionaires, led by Hank & Doug Meijer, whose supermarket empire gives them a net worth of $7.3 billion.

At the other end of the spectrum, Michigan is home to one of the least expensive places to live in the U.S. The cost of living in Kalamazoo is 20.5% below the U.S. average. Overall, Michigan is 14.1% cheaper than the national average.

Michigan's tax situation is mixed. It's one of just a handful of U.S. states with a flat tax -- the rate is a modest 4.25%. But cities can levy income taxes as well. Property taxes, particularly in Detroit, are steep.

With a cost of living 11.1% lower than the national average, a million dollars goes a bit further in the Peach State than elsewhere.

But taxes do take their bite. Georgia's tax brackets mean that many taxpayers will find themselves paying the top marginal rate, which kicks in at just $10,000 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly or $7,000 for individual filers. Sales taxes lean high, and in some areas, groceries will be taxed as well.

Kansas is known more for affordable living than for putting on the ritz. Indeed, Salina and Pittsburg, Kansas, are two of the cheapest small towns in America. Statewide, the cost of living in Kansas is 11.3% cheaper than the national average.

Offsetting that somewhat is the fact that Kansas is not the friendliest state when it comes to taxes. Sales taxes are high (and are applied to groceries), and property taxes are steep, too. Taxes in Kansas aren't kind to retirees either.

Against that backdrop, the Sunflower State has 62,073 millionaire households out of a total of about 1.1 million households.

Florida's popularity as a retirement destination helps boost its concentration of millionaires. Indeed, an hour's drive north of Walt Disney World, you'll find The Villages, a sprawling retirement haven with one of the highest numbers of millionaires per capita in the country.

The Sunshine State is well-known for its absence of a state income tax, which helps put it into Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states. Property taxes are below the midpoint for the U.S. The cost of living, meanwhile, is 3.6% below the national average.

Wyoming might have the smallest population of any state, but it has one of the higher concentration of millionaires, thanks to abundant natural resources and recreational activities.

Wyoming accounts for about 40% of the nation's coal production, and the vast majority of the state's output comes from the Gillette area, which has a high concentration of millionaires as a result. Wyoming's famed Jackson Hole valley, with three major ski resorts and an abundance of other year-round recreational activities, also is a mecca for millionaires.

Thanks to abundant revenue that the state collects from oil and mineral rights, Wyoming millionaires shoulder one of the lowest tax burdens in the U.S.

Tiny Vermont has just 15,090 millionaire households, and the Green Mountain State is one of the tougher states when it comes to taxing millionaires. It's a pricey place to live if you're wealthy. Among other policies, income tax rates reach 8.75%. And Vermont's property taxes are the eighth-highest in the U.S.

Vermont is a comparatively expensive state in which to live in other ways, too. The state's cost of living is 12.8% higher than the national average.

The Beaver State's cost of living is 4.1% higher than the U.S. average. That/s partly due to a median home value of more than $265,700, which is well above the national average.

Oregonians also face the country's highest income tax bracket. The 9.9% rate is applied to taxable income over $125,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly), and the lowest bracket is already 5%.

Property taxes are on the high side, too.

The explosion in shale oil drilling has minted many a millionaire in North Dakota over the past decade. Indeed, small towns such as Dickinson and Williston, located in the oil-rich Bakken Formation, have some of the highest concentrations of millionaires in the U.S. Last year, as oil prices reached multiyear highs for several months, North Dakota enjoyed record-breaking oil production.

North Dakota is one of the nation's tax-friendliest states. The Peace Garden State offers modest sales taxes that favor agriculture and has been cutting income taxes for several years in a row -- to the point that they're barely there. To top it off, the cost of living in is 2.9% lower than the national average.

More than 6% of Pennsylvania's 5 million-plus households have investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding the value of real estate, employer-sponsored retirement plans and business partnerships. That puts the state's concentration of millionaires close to the national percentage, even as the cost of living in the Keystone State is 1.1% lower than the U.S. average.

The Keystone State's tax picture is mixed. It has a flat income tax rate of 3.07%, but municipalities can add to that with local earned income taxes. While sales taxes are relatively low, the state's fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes are notably high.

Everything is bigger in Texas. No, it doesn't have the highest concentration of millionaires, but in terms of raw numbers, only California has more than the Lone Star State's 622,065 millionaire households.

Heck, Texas is so big it not only has two of the smallest towns with the most millionaires in the U.S. -- Andrews and Fredericksburg -- but it's also home to four of the 10 cheapest U.S. cities in which to live. (Those would be Brownsville, Wichita Falls, Harlingen and McAllen.) On average, the cost of living in Texas is 8.7% lower than the U.S. average.

Texas is a place of extremes when it comes to taxes, too. There's no income tax at all. On the other hand, sales taxes run high, as do property taxes.

Almost 6.4% of Utah's households have more than $1 million in investable assets -- a figure that's partly due to Summit Park, a small town with one of the highest concentrations of millionaires in the country. World-class ski resorts and luxury shopping are the main draw.

As for taxes, millionaires could do worse. Utah, which runs a flat-tax system, lowered the rate by a hair (from 5.0% to 4.95%) in 2018. However, the loss of the federal personal exemption due to the new tax law means that many Utahans, particularly those with multiple dependents, will pay higher state taxes than before. Property taxes are low and sales taxes are average.

When people think about Rhode Island and millionaires, Newport and its grand 19th century mansions naturally come to mind. But today's picture is more pedestrian. With more than 27,000 millionaire households out of 418,295 total, Rhode Island has merely an above-average concentration of millionaires. Unhappily, taxes and expenses in the Ocean State are on the high side too.

The cost of living in Rhode Island is 12.5% higher than the national average. As for taxes, the state is expensive for homeowners. Property tax on the state's median home value is the 10th-highest in the U.S. Sales taxes are on the pricey side (and are above its neighboring states), but the income-tax bite is modest.

Well-paid jobs in the finance and insurance industries, as well as the presence of major companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and AstraZeneca (AZN), help fuel a high concentration of millionaire households in Delaware.

Delaware's cost of living is just 0.6% below the U.S. average. The First State has no sales tax and low property taxes, but income taxes hit 6.6% on taxable income above $60,000. However, Delaware still is one of Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states.

Illinois has a higher concentration of millionaires than the national average, but then, a million bucks doesn't go as far in the Prairie State as it does in much of the rest of the country.

The cost of living for Illinois is 4% above the U.S. average, and taxes can take quite a toll. Indeed, Illinois is one of Kiplinger's top 10 least tax-friendly states. Property taxes in Illinois are the second-highest in the nation and combined sales taxes can be as high as 10%. Even prescription drugs are taxed, albeit only at 1%.

Minnesota is loaded with giant companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM), Target (TGT) and General Mills (GIS) are just a few of the major firms headquartered there. They help drive an economy that supports more than 150,000 millionaire households.

Although Minnesota affords residents a cost of living that's 4.3% below the national average, it hits hard with income tax. It added a new top income-tax rate of 9.85% in 2013.

But what makes Minnesota really stand out is that its lowest income-tax rate is 5.35%. The state offers cold comfort on taxes for retirees too.

Colorado has a relatively high concentration of millionaire households partly because it's an outdoor recreational paradise. The small town of Edwards, for example, is bristling with millionaires thanks to nearby word-class ski resorts such as Vail and Beaver Creek.

Both median income and home value are well above national averages in Colorado, as is the cost of living, albeit only by 0.8%. Property taxes are quite low, but sales taxes take a bite. The Centennial State has a flat tax. If you have federal taxable income, the rate is 4.63%. For retirees, the tax picture is mixed.

New York State has the third-most millionaire households in raw numbers after California and Texas. They're disproportionately located in the greater New York City area, however, where a million bucks doesn't go that far.

Manhattan is the most expensive place to live in the country at a whopping 138.6% above the U.S. average. For New York State as a whole, the cost of living is 35.9% higher than the national average.

Taxes can be brutal, too; the Empire State is among the least-friendly in the nation. Income, property and sales tax are all high, and New York's cigarette tax is the highest in the country. Suffice to say, New York State taxes aren't easy on retirees, either.

The good news is that Washington is one of seven states with no broad-based personal income tax. The bad news is that combined state and local sales tax rates are some of the highest in the nation. And the cost of living is 7.9% higher than the national average.

Although Washington is home to the two richest people in the world -- Amazon.com (AMZN) honcho Jeff Bezos and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates -- the state's well-to-do live closer to Earth. Seattle -- America's fastest-growing city this decade -- is also one of the most expensive.

Millionaires also can be found outside the Emerald City that Bezos and Gates call home. Tiny Oak Harbor, Washington, has one of the highest concentrations of millionaires of any small town in America.

Virginia's high concentration of millionaires is largely driven by Washington, D.C., and it's close-in suburbs such Arlington and McLean. The greater D.C. area is a magnet for the highly educated seeking high-powered jobs.

Although Virginia's D.C. suburbs are among the more expensive places to live in the U.S., the state as a whole is comparatively affordable. Virginia's cost of living is 1.7% lower than the national average.

Income taxes are middle-of-the-road when compared with other states, while property taxes are relatively low. The Old Dominion is also kind to seniors. Virginia offers some tax breaks to retirees. It does not tax Social Security benefits, for example, and residents 65 and older can deduct up to $12,000 per person of income, subject to income-eligibility limits.

Oil wealth is what gives Alaska its high percentage of millionaires. Indeed, Juneau, the state capital, has the third-highest concentration of millionaire households in the country.

The downside is that everything costs more in Alaska because it's so remote. Groceries alone cost 50% more in Juneau. Overall, the cost of living in the Last Frontier is 18.5% higher than the national average.

On the other hand, Alaska is the most tax-friendly state in the country. State income tax doesn't exist; in fact, the government actually pays residents an annual stipend. This year, each legal resident will receive $1,600, which is down from a peak of $2,072 in 2015 because of falling oil prices, but it's a lot better than having to pay in.

The Golden State is home to the most millionaires in the nation, at more than 1 million households, and claims four of the top 10 metro areas with the highest concentrations of millionaires.

The greater Napa, San Francisco, San Jose and Oxnard metro areas are loaded with wealth. In the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metro area, for example, almost 25,000 households have more than $5 million in investable assets.

It almost goes without saying that California is a pricey place to live. The cost of living is a third higher than the U.S. average. Taxes, especially on big earners, are aggressive. California has the highest tax rate in the country, at 13.3% (for millionaires). Sales and fuel taxes are high too.

New Hampshire's high concentration of millionaires hinges on Concord and Laconia. In the former case, the state capital is home to a horde of state, county, local and federal agencies -- and the law firms and professional agencies that support them. Laconia and the state's famed Lakes Region benefits from its popularity as tourism hub.

Although N.H. is a relatively tax-friendly state -- especially for retirees -- the high concentration of millionaires contributes to relatively high living costs. Expenses in the Granite State run 14.7% above the U.S. average.

It should come as no surprise that a tropical paradise would be a magnet for millionaires. Kapaa, on Hawaii's fourth-largest island of Kauai, and Honolulu have some of the highest concentration of millionaire households in the U.S.

But paradise doesn't come cheap. Blame Hawaii's remoteness, making pretty much everything more expensive than it would be on the mainland. The cost of living in the Aloha State is 26.9% higher than the national average. Taxes are rough, too. The top tax bracket is an eye-popping 11%.

Seniors, however, catch a break. Hawaii exempts Social Security benefits as well as most pension income from state income taxes.

From the greater Boston area to the tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts has more than its fair share of millionaire households. With its unparalleled collection of universities, hospitals, historical sites, and tech and biotech employers, Boston is a center of wealth, as well as one of the priciest cities in the U.S. On the smaller side of things, Barnstable, and Martha's Vineyard have some of the highest concentrations of millionaires in the country.

No wonder Massachusetts has a cost of living 20.7% higher than the national average.

However, while the Bay State gets dubbed ""Taxachusetts,"" that's not really fair. Taxes are decidedly average.

For the first time since 2010, Maryland is no longer the top state for millionaires per capita. Don't feel bad for the Old Line State, however. It still has one of the highest concentrations of millionaire households of any state in the union.

As with Virginia, that's partly thanks to its Washington, D.C., suburbs, but the pull of the nation's capital can't take all the credit. The California-Lexington Park metro area also has one of the country's highest concentrations of millionaires. Tiny Easton, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay, punches well above its weight when it comes to millionaire households, too.

Steep local income taxes make Maryland one of Kiplinger's least tax-friendly states. A cost of living that's 21.4% higher than the national average is another negative.

Connecticut's Stamford metro area, which includes Norwalk and Bridgeport, has the highest concentration of millionaires in the U.S. Some are wealthy commuters who make their livings in the Big Apple. Others made their fortunes closer to home. The southwest corner of the state is the base for many hedge funds and prominent public companies.

Torrington, the largest town in Litchfield County -- which has long been a popular retreat for Manhattan's wealthy and chic looking for a remote, mountainous getaway -- also has more than its fair share of the well-to-do.

But it's expensive to be a millionaire in Connecticut. Real estate taxes are the fourth-highest in the country, and the state has not only a gift tax, but a luxury tax. Furthermore, the cost of living in the Nutmeg State is 18.5% greater than the national average.

Washington, D.C., saw the highest growth of millionaires per capita year-over-year, Phoenix Marketing International notes, rising to 8.94% in 2018 from 6.57% in 2017. That allowed the nation's capital to jump nine places in the state rankings.

PMI's Thompson attributes the leap to several factors, ""including increased property prices and movement of skilled workers to the area.""

Although the District of Columbia is a magnet for the highly educated seeking high-powered jobs, the downside is that you need a hefty paycheck to live there. Rents and mortgages are more than double the national average, making the nation's capital one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.

Furthermore, D.C. is decidedly unfriendly when it comes to taxes. Although property and sales taxes are unexceptional, the nation's capital takes a huge bite of income. Neither is the city particularly tax-friendly for retirees.

New Jersey wrested the top spot for millionaires per capita from Maryland in 2018. Like Connecticut, New Jersey has a high concentration of millionaires largely thanks to its proximity to New York City. But not all of New Jersey's millionaires are clustered near the Big Apple. Farther south, the state capital of Trenton -- and its metro area that includes tony Princeton -- has plenty of millionaires, as well.

Also like Connecticut, the Garden State is pricey and taxes are high. N.J.'s cost of living is 13.4% higher than the U.S. average. Although New Jersey gives residents a break on income taxes, it brings the hammer down when they buy a home. New Jersey's property taxes are the highest in America.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-needs-movies-more-multiplex-164849318.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T16:48:49+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As Amazon.com Inc. approaches the third anniversary of its Whole Foods Market acquisition, there’s speculation that the tech giant could set its sights on AMC Entertainment Inc. for its next oddball deal. But modernizing an already popular supermarket and luring shoppers with discounts on avocados isn’t the same as running a movie-theater chain — that would amount to a rescue mission. If Jeff Bezos wants to deepen his Hollywood ties, why not buy a studio instead?

Amazon is said to have studied a deal for AMC and the two sides may have held talks, according to a May 9 report in the British newspaper the Daily Mail citing unnamed sources. Deadline later contradicted the story, saying there aren’t any discussions. This may turn out to be a case in which investor hope, rather than deal logic, was informing a rumor. AMC is the largest cinema operator in the U.S. and Europe, where it owns the Odeon & UCI circuit. That purchase, along with the takeover of its U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas and a costly theater renovation streak, has left AMC with a large debt burden that now threatens to topple the company as most of its cinemas remain closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The dwindling box office isn’t just a temporary quarantine-related problem. A nearly doubling in the price of movie tickets over the last two decades has masked an otherwise gradual decline in patronage. After regional stay-at-home orders lift, prolonged virus fears and a continued shift toward at-home video streaming will take even more of a toll. Studios are beginning to experiment with on-demand releases that are either concurrent with theatrical debuts or skip movie houses entirely, as Universal Studios chose to do with its “Trolls World Tour” premiere last month. Though AMC does sell its own on-demand movie access through the new Theatres On Demand platform, Amazon Prime Video is already a more established destination.

What Amazon would be buying is a heap of debt and empty auditoriums. And what in the world is Bezos going to do with 11,000 exhibition screens? If the future of entertainment is streaming content, then a company like AMC Networks — the channel known for “Breaking Bad” and “The Walking Dead” — is a much more fitting candidate than AMC theaters. But even AMC Networks, which is valued at just $1.3 billion, may still be too niche for Amazon’s needs.

If Bezos truly wants to dominate in streaming entertainment, he should think about acquiring a Hollywood studio. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., ViacomCBS Inc.’s Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. are all options and may be willing sellers. They could help provide the must-see content that Amazon needs more of to drive interest in its Prime Video service. As of now, the “free” movies and shows available to Prime members are more of an extra feature that’s nice to have, but easily forgotten about. In fact, more than three-quarters of Amazon Prime Video members still use Netflix, according to research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. The same argument can be made for Apple Inc. as it invests in the Apple TV+ service, as I wrote last year.

Before June 2017, no one could have predicted that Bezos, a tech mogul, would scoop up the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.6 billion and that it would be his largest takeover ever. Even now, the affiliation with Amazon hasn’t done much to change the Whole Foods shopping experience. It’s possible that Bezos sees some hidden value in cinemas, but the connection is even less clear than it is with supermarkets. What’s more likely is that Bezos is thinking about the future, where more is done remotely on our devices — especially TV viewing. In that case, Bezos doesn’t need a whole bunch of reclining seats, he needs eyeballs and something to show them.

But, a couple of years ago, office supply retailer Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) switched gears. Although it would still cater to consumers via its stores, it turned up the heat on the business it did with other businesses.

This redirected effort appears to be the key reason the company was able to sidestep coronavirus-related headwinds last quarter. Although sales fell, they didn't fall by much, and same-store sales were actually up year over year. A slightly stronger headwind is expected to take shape for the quarter currently underway, as consumers as well as businesses try to regroup from worldwide lockdowns.

Still, last quarter's resiliency suggests Office Depot's plan to reposition itself as an institution-oriented service provider is working out well.

Not what it once was

Office Depot has been under fire for years thanks to competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). In 2012, Amazon unveiled AmazonSupply.com; it bolstered that move with the launch of Amazon Business in 2015. It underscored its focus on business customers in 2017 when it offered free shipping to select Business Prime customers. The e-commerce giant was the key driving force behind the merger of Office Max and Office Depot in 2013, in fact, and had the FTC not put a stop to it, the Office Max/Office Depot combo would have teamed up with rival Staples in 2015. There's just not much room left for brick-and-mortar retailers in a market Amazon chooses to address.

Office Depot isn't the retailer it used to be, however. In some ways, it's no longer a retailer at all.

The paradigm shift started in earnest in 2017 when the company acquired CompuCom, a business that helps companies establish and protect their technology infrastructure. While a profit center in and of itself, the deal was also a means of augmenting Office Depot's business solutions division (BSD).

As the name suggests, the BSD offers solutions that meet the unique needs of small and medium-sized business, like the use of purchase orders, multiple authorized buyers, and bulk delivery of supplies. Also included in the business solutions division's repertoire are copying and printing services that small and medium-sized businesses need, but often have to outsource. While in place for years and clearly aimed at the non-consumer market, the BSD didn't become a prioritized growth engine until 2018.

Not bad, considering the circumstances

Like their Fortune 500 counterparts, small and mid-sized businesses have been rattled by the coronavirus, although not as much as one might expect. Office Depot's BSD revenue only slumped 1% year over year for the three-month stretch ending in March, while CompuCom's top line fell 5%. Factoring in store sales to brick-and-mortar shoppers, a combination of consumers and business customers, companywide revenue only fell 2% last quarter, and cost-cutting led to a 233% increase in operating profits.

In an environment where many of these small and medium-sized business were shut down due to COVID-19, it's a ray of hope that Office Depot's core target market is holding up even if forgivable government loans were their ultimate lifeline.

Perhaps just as important, last quarter's relative strength can be counted as an extension of the success some investors might be surprised to see Office Depot is mustering, including measurable (even if inconsistent) operating income growth.

Amazon's foray into the business was a challenge, but Office Depot has found a way to fight back. Even the company's traditional retail business, which serves consumers and companies alike inside its stores, has been able to drive some growth when it seemingly shouldn't have. There are still some geographically localized things Amazon just can't do very well. Office Depot is capitalizing on that soft spot in Amazon's armor.

Hope floats

The optimism comes with a footnote. While last quarter was surprisingly respectable, Office Depot retracted its 2020 earnings guidance. The official quarterly statement addressed the business solutions division's headwind, ""We expect these conditions to temporarily impact trends in the second quarter of 2020, resulting in declining revenue in the Company's contract channel as many businesses have paused operations or have temporarily migrated to a distributed remote workforce solution."" Analysts are modeling a 6% revenue tumble for the quarter to end in June. Results should steady from there and ideally lead into a rebound headed out of 2021; clearly patience is required.

Shareholders should also accept that an investment in Office Depot is also ultimately a bet on the survival of mid-sized and small businesses in America. Without them, the company doesn't have much of a strategic advantage. Bigger companies have in-house solutions. Micro businesses and sole proprietors don't need much of what makes Office Depot unique.

There's still good reason for hope, though.

Even aside from last quarter's resilience, small and mid-sized business owners still feel good about the future. A recent survey taken by The Harris Poll and HR solutions provider TriNet found that, despite awareness that the economic situation poses incredible risks to their survival, many small and medium-sized businesses are still counting on a fruitful future. Nearly 50% of those polled are increasing investments in their digital infrastructure, while 92% of them believe they could last another three months in the current business environment. That should be enough time to put the fallout from COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, which bodes well for Office Depot's focus.

Bottom line

If there was any question whether Office Depot is now more of a business-to-business name than not, it was answered Wednesday: It is. That's a good thing, too, as the consumer piece of the office supply market is increasingly competitive due to competition from Amazon as well as Walmart, just by the virtue of its geographical footprint.

More than anything, however, last quarter's decent results affirm Office Depot has successfully repositioned itself as an indispensable business support and service partner. It's still subject to economic cycles, but it's at least now somewhat walled off from the consumer-oriented retail apocalypse."

During the first quarter of 2020, the RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund returned 9.48% (institutional shares), compared to the total return of -19.60% by the S&P 500 Index. You should check out RiverPark’s top 5 stock picks which helped them beat the market by nearly 30 percentage points. There weren’t a lot of funds who could deliver these kinds of returns without shorting the market or using aggressive put options.

In the said letter, RiverPark Advisors highlighted a few stocks and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) is one of them. Snap is a social media company. Year-to-date, SNAP stock gained 11.2% and on May 7th it had a closing price of $18.15. Its market cap is of $26.3 billion. Here is what RiverPark Advisors said:

""Snap is known for its mobile-only picture and messaging application Snapchat. Snapchat reaches 90% of 13-24-year-olds in the US and has 218 million Daily Active Users who spend about 30 minutes/day on the platform producing more than 10 billion daily video views. We expect SNAPs average revenue per user (ARPU) to grow from its current $8 per year to more than $20 by 2023. For reference, Facebook generates a $50 ARPU and Twitter $25. Increasing users, engagement and ARPU should drive a 35% revenue CAGR through 2023, as well as expand gross margins from 56% for 4Q19 to 80%. We believe that the combination of continued strong growth in user engagement with increasing monetization will lead to a period of sustained and highly profitable growth for the company over the next several years.""

As you can see RiverPark believes SNAP has the potential to be the next Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) by increased user engagement. In Q4 2019, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on SNAP stock increased by about 22% from the previous quarter (see the chart here), so a number of other hedge fund managers seem to agree with SNAP’s huge upside potential.

TikTok, the social video company owned by Chinese company ByteDance, might be the biggest gainer of the outbreak as it has now surpassed 2 billion downloads. In the first quarter of 2020, TikTok generated the most downloads for any app ever in a quarter as it accumulated more than 315 million installs through Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) App Store and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAG:GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play.

Facebook

Last week, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) announced its revenue came in at $17.74 billion, up nearly 18% from the $15.08 billion the company reported in the first quarter of 2019. It gathered 2.99 billion monthly users across its family of apps: Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger which is more than 2.89 billion it had in the previous quarter. Earnings per share were slightly less than Refinitiv's $1.75 estimate, as they amounted to $1.71. Revenue came to $17.74 billion which is greater than $17.41 billion in revenue for the first quarter. Daily active users (DAUs) came in at 1.73 billion with as many as 2.6 billion monthly active users (MAUs).

After a harsh hit in March, Facebook is now seeing signs of stabilization when it comes to advertising revenue. Early data for April certainly looks more promising, and this echoes what Google saw with its own advertising business. With cash and cash equivalents at $60.29 billion and its traditionally high margins, Facebook has a financial position that allows the company to continue building its product portfolio and making bets, such as last month's $5.7 billion investment in India's Jio Platforms.

Twitter

Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) monetizable daily active users (mDAU growth) exploded from 152 million in the last quarter to 166 million thanks to global conversation that the outbreak triggered. The company reported first-quarter earnings were in-line with Wall Street estimates with a revenue beat despite the COVID-19 taking a toll on advertising overall.

Twitter's Q1 2020 diluted earnings per share were -$0.01 on revenue of $808 million, which is down from $1.01 billion last quarter but up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Like Facebook, Twitter is seeing rapid user growth, but with challenges to monetize it as advertisers are slashing on spending. With an increase to 14 million, the all-important mDAU metric grew 24% year-over-year. However, operating income for the quarter ended up being a loss of $7 million.

Snap And Pinterest

Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) reported an $0.08 loss per share, which was slightly above last year's reading. Revenue came in at $462 million, which beat Wall Street's estimate and grew significantly on a year-over-year basis. However, results, and despite posting a slight miss on earnings and withdrawing full-year guidance, shares have soared as the company managed to beat top-line revenues.

The company also said that daily active users were up 20% year-over-year to 228 million, and that the total daily time spent watching content on the ""Discover"" tab increased by over 35%.

Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) reported a loss of $0.10 per share last quarter, missing the $0.08 loss estimate. Top-line revenue was a little better however, with the $271 million figure coming slightly above the consensus estimate. Monthly Active Users increased 26% year-over-year to 367 million."

This may be smoke or just rumors but the stock price is up and it's worth a look.

In this daily bar chart of AMC, below, we can see that it made a very small base in March and April with three tests of the $2 level. Prices rallied in the second half of April and climbed above the declining 50-day moving average line.

Trading volume has increased the past two months and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has shot up sharply.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved above the zero line in late April for an outright go long signal.

In this weekly bar chart of AMC, below, we can see that prices have been weak the past three years. The price action on this chart looks like a bounce in a downtrend. Prices are below the negative sloped 40-week moving average line.

The weekly OBV line shows some recent improvement and the MACD oscillator could be crossing towards a cover shorts buy signal.

In this daily Point and Figure chart of AMC, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $11.

Bottom line strategy: I am not a fly on the wall of a corporate board room so the chart needs to speak for itself. Do I want to risk below $4 to go long AMC for a possible rally to $11? Not all that compelling in my opinion."

Reopening crowded theaters, schools and air travel with passengers seated cheek-to-jowl risks reigniting the epidemic. Businesses may go to considerable expense to make more essential activities like food-processing plants safer, for example, by installing shields between employees but other less-essential activities will come back more slowly.

A second wave of infections is more likely when an effective vaccine is not yet widely available and the population is initially shielded through social distancing. For now, authorities should rely on testing to identify new infections and those immune, quarantining and tracing or personal surveillance.

Cell phones with Bluetooth-enabled apps could log our personal contacts and movements to enable quick identification of those exposed to newly infected individuals. For the time being, though, local governments mostly will rely on armies of tracers — folks that interview the newly infected about their recent associations.

Americans may balk at cell phone tracking owing to privacy concerns but as it becomes an option, it should be quicker and more effective. Google GOOG, -1.96% , Facebook FB, -1.44% , Twitter TWTR, -1.81% and cell-phone companies already collect data that is used to place ads on our web searches. I trust politicians a lot more with my private information than most high-tech CEOs — they are less insular and subject to better oversight and removal.

We can’t afford not to trust the government. If the economy stays mostly closed through May, unemployment — measured and hidden — will likely jump above 20% and that implies a $5 trillion-plus drop in economic activity. Federal loans to businesses that don’t convert to grants and private borrowing are creating a mountain of debt similar to the financial crisis.

All that will radically limit consumer spending, business investment, and state and local government budgets for the next several years. And if we wait until we have reliable, widely available effective treatments and vaccines, the economy could be so damaged that we relive the Great Depression.

The shutdown is closing some businesses permanently — small businesses being less diversified and generally having less financial ballast are more vulnerable.

More folks who visited restaurants after tough days on the job have discovered delivered meals, creating opportunities for virtual restaurants in industrial kitchens. Twenty-five percent of sit-down eateries now closed may never reopen.

Zoom US:ZOOM is hardly perfect but overloaded servers and security vulnerabilities can be fixed, and businesses have discovered they can get along without subjecting employees to quite so much commuting and air travel.

This whole episode has accelerated the growth of Amazon AMZN, -2.16% , Walmart WMT, +0.08% and Target TGT, -0.65% at the expense of conventional brick and mortar, the advent of machine and software robots, widespread telemedicine and education, watching movies and working at home, and the retreat of automobiles.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act might have better been labeled Project Brigadoon, because it emphasizes subsidizing businesses to maintain pre-existing payrolls, union contracts and the like. That implicitly assumes the economy can be reawakened to its prior condition in February.

Unemployment benefits that exceed weekly pay encourages larger companies to lay off employees and for those workers to wait for old jobs to return, but many businesses are permanently closed or scale backed. Many loans the Treasury, Small Business Administration and Federal Reserve have underwritten will fail, and grants to keep workers in place will prove wasted.

Many department stores are through — either chains will close forever, or the number of outlets downsized. Malls without anchors will not attract enough traffic for smaller tenants, and temporary closures are encouraging clothing and other brands to rely more on direct to consumer sales.

The viability of mall owners and their creditors will be impaired—just like those who extended credit to Neiman Marcus and other big chains.

Big tech is doing well—Facebook, Amazon, Apple AAPL, -1.14% , Netflix NFLX, -1.97% and Google—and many are or will be hiring. They dominate large-cap stock indexes like the S&P SPX, -2.05% Macy’s MACY, -1.46% and J.C. Penney JCP, +28.73% , for example, are not on the S&P 500 because of low valuations.

The recovery will look like a truncated V. After a sharp decline, a steep recovery but not to the same level as before. The stock market, as measured by indexes mostly dominated by big-cap stocks, will recover more quickly."
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amazon-microsoft-trade-insults-jedi-contract?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO,AMZN,2020-05-08T19:27:42+00:00,"Amazon filed a protest this week with the Pentagon requesting more clarity on the bidding process, and the two tech giants traded barbs about their respective claims.

In case there was any doubt, the gloves are officially off in Microsoft and Amazon's ongoing cloud battle.

The two tech giants swapped testy blog posts this week over the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI cloud contract, which was surprisingly awarded to Microsoft last year. Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report and Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Report are locked in a high-stakes lawsuit over the bidding process for the contract.

In a blog post on Thursday, Microsoft VP of communications Frank Shaw depicted Amazon as a sore loser that is ""asking for a do-over"" in the bidding process and interfering with necessary work at the Pentagon. Earlier this year, a judge granted a request by Amazon that Microsoft and the Pentagon postpone work on the project until the conflict plays out in the courts.

Not to be outflanked, Amazon PR exec Drew Herdener took to the AWS blog on Friday to ""[set] the record straight.""

""Recently, Microsoft has published multiple self-righteous and pontificating blog posts that amount to nothing more than misleading noise intended to distract those following the protest,"" he wrote. ""Nobody knowledgeable and objective believes they have the better offering. And, this has been further underscored by their spotty operational performance during the COVID-19 crisis (and in 2020 YTD).""

Ouch. And yet the burns are far from petty in light of the stakes in the $10 billion deal.

Microsoft's posts this week were triggered by a new development in the court fight, with Amazon filing a concurrent protest directly with the Pentagon requesting more clarity on the bidding process, which Amazon claims was unfair. In Amazon's original court complaint, it alleged that the Pentagon's process for awarding the contract was tainted by ""egregious errors,"" as well as meddling by President Trump. Trump has expressed disdain for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in the past, and claimed at a news conference last year that the process was unfairly weighted towards Amazon.

The deal is also viewed as a milestone in the future of cloud computing.

Amazon's AWS is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and services, but Microsoft's second-place Azure has been capturing share as the market grows as a whole. And the ten-year JEDI deal could open up more opportunities for Microsoft, with federal cloud spending expected to surge to $9.1 billion by 2024, up from $5.3 billion last year, according to Deltek.

Microsoft shares climbed to record highs after the JEDI deal was announced in October 2019.

Given sensitivities with military work, some of the lawsuit's details are non-public. The Pentagon's inspector general also investigated the bidding process and found that Microsoft's victory did not appear to stem from White House pressure.

We may not know how the case will ultimately play out, but Court of Federal Claims Judge Patricia E. Campbell Smith, who is overseeing the case, indicated there was an ""error"" in the bidding process. And the Pentagon also requested 120 days to ""reconsider"" certain aspects of the bidding process.

The messy lawsuit could wind up splitting the baby between the two tech giants, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

One outcome could be a protracted court battle, with work on the JEDI project delayed. The other possible scenario, according to Ives, is that ""the Pentagon reconsiders the bid and ultimately breaks the $10 billion bid up between Microsoft and Amazon (and potentially other vendors) and moves this forward and out of the courts.""

""While initially this was a single source contract, we believe the writing is on the wall that the Pentagon needs to likely break up this contract in order to move it along and start the procurement process given how critical the JEDI deal is to the overall DOD and longer term strategic global military operations/infrastructure,"" he wrote.

Shares of Microsoft have gained 14% year to date, while Amazon shares are up 28%.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) seemed to be a model of superior survival techniques. Now, Apple is approaching future catalysts from a position of strength, according to Wedbush.

The Apple Analyst

Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Apple and raised the price target from $335 to $350.

The Apple Thesis

For the most part, Apple has remained unshaken by COVID-19, according to Wedbush.

Its global demand and supply chain have weathered the storm. Yet the lengthening of global lockdowns and the impending economic fallout are expected to delay the company’s recovery, in the research firm's view.

“To this point, we have continued to encourage investors to use this near-term uncertainty as an opportunity to buy the stock for the other side of the dark valley,” Ives said in a Tuesday note. (See his track record here.)

The analyst said he sees “Teflon-like” strength in the company’s services segment and values the unit between $500 billion and $600 billion.

“Looking ahead, with stores opening up to strong demand throughout Asia and a handful of U.S. stores opening up this week, coupled by a recovering supply chain which is on the path to normalization, it appears Apple is starting to lay the early groundwork for the next chapter of growth recovery in Cupertino.”

The launch of the iPhone 12 should help, although Ives sees only a 15% chance of the 5G phones debuting as expected in October.

The analyst anticipates a delay to November or December in response to supply chain disruptions and soft economic conditions. At that point, Wedbush projects that at least 350 million iPhones worldwide will be turned in for the upgrade.

AAPL Price Action

At the time of publication Tuesday, Apple shares were trading 0.9% higher at $317.84.

3M, PwC, and Allen Institute among customers and partners using Amazon Kendra

Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Kendra, a highly accurate and easy to use enterprise search service powered by machine learning. With just a few clicks, Amazon Kendra uses machine learning to enable organizations to index all of their internal data sources, make that data searchable, and allow users to get precise answers to natural language queries. When users ask a question, Amazon Kendra uses finely tuned machine learning algorithms to understand the context and return the most relevant results, whether that be a precise answer or an entire document. For example, businesses can use Amazon Kendra to search internal documents spread across portals and wikis, research organizations can create a searchable archive of experiments and notes, and contact centers can use Amazon Kendra to find the right answer to customer questions across the complete library of support documentation. Amazon Kendra requires no machine learning expertise and can be set up completely within the AWS Management Console. To get started with Amazon Kendra, visit https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/

Despite many attempts over many years, searching for information within an organization remains a vexing problem for today’s enterprises. Many businesses and organizations struggle implementing internal search across their siloed troves of data, requiring their end-users to use keywords to find information. Organizations have vast amounts of unstructured text data, much of it incredibly useful if it can be discovered, stored in many formats, and spread across different data sources (e.g. SharePoint, Intranet, Amazon Simple Storage Service, and on-premises file storage systems). Even with common web-based search tools widely available, organizations still find internal search difficult because none of the available tools do a good job indexing across existing data silos, don’t provide natural language queries, and can’t deliver accurate results. When end-users have questions, they are required to use keywords that may appear in multiple documents in different contexts, and these searches typically generate long lists of random links that end-users have to sift through to find the information they seek – if they find it at all.

Amazon Kendra reinvents enterprise search by allowing end-users to search across multiple silos of data using real questions (not just keywords) and leverages machine learning models under the hood to understand the content of documents and the relationships between them to deliver the precise answers they seek (instead of a random list of links). Because natural language understanding is at the core of Amazon Kendra’s search engine, employees can run their searches using natural language (keywords still work, but most users prefer natural language searches). As an example, an employee can ask a specific question like ""when does the IT help desk open?"" and Amazon Kendra will give them a specific answer like ""9:30 AM,"" and highlight the passage in the source document where it found the answer, along with links back to the IT ticketing portal and other relevant sites. Amazon Kendra is also optimized to understand complex language from multiple domains, including IT (e.g. ""How do I set up my VPN?""), healthcare and life sciences (e.g. ""What is the genetic marker for ALS?""), and insurance (e.g. ""How long does it take for policy changes to go into effect?""). Currently, Amazon Kendra supports industry-specific language from IT, healthcare, and insurance, plus energy, industrial, financial services, legal, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, human resources, news, telecommunications, mining, food and beverage, and automotive, with additional industry support coming in the second half of this year.

""Our customers often tell us that search in their organizations is difficult to implement, slows down productivity, and frequently doesn’t work because their data is scattered across many silos in many formats. Using keywords is also counterintuitive, and the results returned often require scanning through many irrelevant links and documents to find useful information,"" said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services, Inc. ""Today, we’re excited to make Amazon Kendra available to our customers and enable them to empower their employees with highly accurate, machine learning-powered enterprise search, which makes it easier for them to find the answers they seek across the full wealth of an organization’s data.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 13 U.S. attorneys general on Tuesday asked Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> to provide data on coronavirus-related deaths and infections among its workforce, along with evidence of the company's compliance with paid sick leave laws.

In a letter, the officials asked for a state-by-state breakdown of the number of Amazon workers, including those at Whole Foods, who have been infected or died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

The letter, led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, was joined by states including Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

The same group of attorneys general had written to the company in March asking it to improve its paid-leave policy.

On Tuesday, they asked for assurance that Amazon would not retaliate against workers who raise concerns about health and safety issues with management, the media, co-workers or relevant government agencies.

In a statement, Amazon said it is committed to ensuring a safe workplace and has implemented over 150 changes, including distributing face masks to warehouse workers.

""We’ll continue to invest in safety, pay, and benefits for our teams who are playing an invaluable role in getting items to communities around the world,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on Tuesday.

In recent weeks, Amazon has fired at least four workers for raising concerns about workplace safety. The company has previously said the workers were let go for violating internal company protocol.

Democratics Ask Five Companies to Repay Aid (6:08 a.m. HK)

Democratic members of a new House panel created to oversee coronavirus relief spending demanded that five publicly owned companies immediately return taxpayer funds the lawmakers said were intended for smaller businesses. The Republican members of the panel didn’t sign the letters, and Representative Steve Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican and a member of the committee, blasted Democrats for making the panel’s first official act “blindly sending harassing letters to individual companies that followed the law.”

The letters were sent to EVO Transportation & Energy Services Inc.; Gulf Island Fabrication Inc.; MiMedx Group Inc.; Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc.; and Quantum Corp. The companies didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment. A statement by the panel, led by Chairman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said the companies all are publicly owned, have market capitalization of more than $25 million, have more than 600 employees, and sought and received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program for small business of at least $10 million.

Pence Press Secretary Tests Positive (5:30 p.m. NY)

Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, President Donald Trump said, briefly delaying the vice president’s departure for a trip to Iowa.

She is the second person working in the executive residence to test positive this week.

Pence’s trip was delayed for more than an hour Friday amid concern over the test result, though Miller wasn’t aboard the flight and the staffers who had contact with her left the aircraft.

California Plans Mail-In Vote (4:41 p.m. NY)

Every California voter will receive a mail-in ballot for the November election as a way to ensure public safety during the pandemic, state officials reported. Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order Friday directing counties to send ballots to all registered voters while also drafting plans to maintain physical polling places.

Voting by mail has turned into a partisan issue, with Republicans claiming it can be subject to fraud. Newsom has cast it though as vital to protecting public health. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla called for young, healthy volunteers to staff polling sites for the Nov. 3 election, saying many people who have volunteered in the past are elderly and face greater risk from the coronavirus.

The initiative relaunched April 21 with an added $320 billion, with loans of $175.7 billion approved in five days. The Small Business Administration reported processing $10 billion since then -- a daily pace of $2.4 billion. At the current rate, it would take 10 weeks to exhaust the remaining funding.

Trump: WHO Is ‘Puppet for China’ (9:15 a.m. NY)

President Donald Trump said the U.S. will soon announce plans on funding for the World Health Organization, which he says was complicit in the spread of the virus by accepting China’s claims about the severity of the outbreak.

“They’re a puppet for China,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends” on Friday. “We’ve been paying so much more than anybody else. And I blame that on our politicians. To be honest with you, our politicians probably could’ve exerted a lot of force.”

Trump last month temporarily suspended U.S. payments to the United Nations agency amid criticism from Democrats over his administration’s response to the virus crisis. The U.S. gives $450 million to WHO, the president said, while China pays $38 million.

U.S. Jobless Rate Triples to 14.7% (8:30 a.m. NY)

U.S. employers cut an unprecedented 20.5 million workers in April as the coronavirus-forced lockdown reversed a decade of labor-market gains in a single month.

Austria’s Kurz Optimistic on Lifting German Border Checks (6:18 a.m. NY)

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is “optimistic” that checks and restrictions at the country’s border with Germany can be lifted in coming weeks, he told journalists in Vienna. Keeping the checks, which currently impose a two-week quarantine for people entering Germany from Austria, would be a blow for Austria’s summer season, where German tourists are the most important group.

Kurz said lifting the checks would also be crucial for commuters in regions close to the border and for business trips in the countries’ closely linked industries.

Covid Is Type of Virus That Starts in Bats: WHO (2 pm HK)

The novel coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that begin in bats, and it’s still unclear what animal may have transmitted it to humans, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert in animal diseases that jump to humans, said Friday in a briefing with reporters. The virus probably arrived in humans through contact with animals while raising food, though it’s unclear which species, he said.

Cats and ferrets are susceptible to the virus, and dogs to a lesser extent, and it’s important to find which animals can get it to avoid creating a “reservoir” in another species, he said. The first human cases were detected in and around Wuhan, and most people had contact with the animal market, though not all, Ben Embarek said.

Questions about the origin of Sars-CoV2, the virus that has caused the pandemic, have burned hotter since U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that it came from a lab in China. Scientists who have studied the issue maintain that the virus originated in an animal, and probably entered the human population in November.

(GOOGL) missed earnings per share (EPS) estimates after the closing bell on April 28. The stock gapped higher on April 29 and then pulled back slightly. Weakness into May 4 held its semiannual and quarterly pivots at $1,314.17 and $1,301.83. Strength on Friday is shy of its annual and monthly risky levels at $1,408.56 and $1,420.76.

The company behind the internet's leading search engine has missed on EPS in two of the past four quarters. The stock is not cheap, as its P/E ratio is elevated at 27.63 without offering a dividend, according to Macrotrends.

Alphabet stock closed last week at $1,384.34, up just 3.4% year to date and in bull market territory at 37.2% above its March 23 low of $1,008.87. The stock is 9.6% below its all-time intraday high of $1,530.73 set on Feb. 19.

The daily chart for Alphabet

Refinitiv XENITH

The daily chart for Alphabet shows the formation of a golden cross on Aug. 12, when the 50-day simple moving average rose above the 200-day simple moving average. This buy signal indicated that higher prices would follow. This tracked the stock to its all-time intraday high of $3,530.73 set on Feb. 19.

Alphabet shares saw a huge price gap lower on Feb. 24, which pushed the stock below its 50-day simple moving average. The stock then failed to hold its annual pivot at $1,408.56 on Feb. 26. Alphabet then gapped below its semiannual pivot at $1,314.17 on March 6. The 200-day simple moving average gave way on March 11 as the stock plunged to its March 23 low of $1,008.87.

The V-shaped recovery had the stock back up to its 200-day simple moving average at $1,270.22 on April 14. Then came the price gap higher on April 29 on the positive reaction to earnings. Note how the semiannual and quarterly pivots at $1,314.17 and $1,301.83 held on the pullback. The nearby upside potential is to the annual and monthly risky levels at $1,408.56 and $1,420.76, respectively.

The weekly chart for Alphabet

Refinitiv XENITH

The weekly chart for Alphabet is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average at $1,284.00. The stock is also above its 200-week simple moving average, or reversion to the mean, at $1,071.88. Alphabet tested this average on weakness during the week of March 20 as a buying opportunity at $1,053.72.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 47.78 last week, up from 47.78 on May 1. Just before setting the February high, this reading was above 90.00, putting the stock in an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation. The bubble popped, and a bear market decline followed.

Trading strategy: Buy Alphabet shares on weakness to the semiannual and quarterly value levels at $1,314.17 and $1,301.83, and reduce holdings on strength to the annual and monthly risky levels at $1,408.56 and $1,420.76.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.

The second quarter 2020 level was established based upon the March 31 close, and the monthly level for May was established based upon the April 30 close. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week, and new quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year, while annual levels remain in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an ""inflating parabolic bubble"" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered ""too cheap to ignore,"" which is typically followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months.

The investment comes less than a week after Silver Lake invested $748 million in Jio Platforms. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) last month announced a .7 billion investment in the same company.

Reliance said the investment makes Vista Equity the third largest stakeholder in Jio following itself and Facebook.

Why It's Important

The funding values Jio at $68.3 billion, about the same as Silver Lake's investment, and a 12.5% premium to the equity valuation of Facebook's investment.

Jio was launched in late 2016 by Asia's second-richest man Mukesh Ambani, and has since become the largest telecom operator in India. The company has been aggressively expanding in providing digital services in the country, including streaming video-on-demand, music streaming, and news apps.

Its latest interest in e-commerce, in partnership with Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp, presents a challenge to Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) subsidiary Flipkart in the country.

""We believe in the potential of the Digital Society that Jio is building for India,"" Vista Equity CEO Robert Smith said in a statement. ""Mukesh's vision as a global pioneer, alongside Jio's world-class leadership team, have built a platform to scale and advance the data revolution it started.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-calling-shots-markets-173507095.html,AAPL,2020-05-12T17:35:07+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus pandemic has led to a historic economic collapse, both here and around the world. The Federal Reserve responded by slashing rates to zero and vowing to buy trillions of dollars in new assets. What will be the impact of these Fed actions is the question that this week's guest on Masters in Business, Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, tries to answer.

Some expect a rapid recovery and spike in inflation; others see a long, slow recovery, more in the shape of a swoosh than a V.Bianco, a former fixed-income analyst who covers equities, comes at it a bit differently. He says the present economic debate is over whether the economy is experiencing a supply or demand shock. Has the economy crashed because of the mandated business closures, hurting the supply side? Or have consumers, wary of leaving their homes, been the main factor, crushing demand? One thing seems certain: consumer reluctance to resume pre-pandemic activity will play a big part in determining how long the coronavirus hangover lasts.

All of this makes establishing fair value for markets difficult, he says. The Fed's actions have put a floor under stocks, preventing them from falling more than they otherwise might. In contrast with the financial crisis, the Fed has been more aggressive, which also contributed to the sharp rally from the March lows.

Bianco's record is worth noting: He was one of the first analysts who explained the impact of the Fed’s quantitative easing and zero interest-rate policies in 2009.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Smartphone shipments from China's factories to vendors rose 17% in April compared to the same month a year ago, according to government data released on Tuesday.

The numbers suggest an early domestic rebound for smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies and a potential return to normalcy in China for the broader consumer hardware market in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.

Phone makers shipped 40.8 million handsets in April, up from 34.8 million in April 2019, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think tank.

For the first time in years, the organisation did not reveal the percentage of Android devices shipped, a key metric that gave insight into how many smartphones Apple sold in China each month.

Private research firms tracking the smartphone sector such as Canalys, IDC and Counterpoint Research all reported that in the first quarter shipments of Apple devices in China declined in the low single digits.

Rival Huawei managed to keep shipments relatively flat in the quarter while Chinese Android players Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi Corp bore the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak with shipment volumes decreasing by double-digit percentages, according to the research groups.

Apple and its rival smartphone brands do not publicly release regional shipments.

* US economy suffers Great Depression-like job losses

* Uber climbs as ride service bookings recover

* Apple to reopen some US stores next week

* Major indexes post weekly gains (Updates to close of U.S. market)

By Lewis Krauskopf

May 8 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes jumped on Friday and logged solid gains for the week after data on historic job losses due to the coronavirus crisis showed they were slightly fewer than feared.

All 11 S&P 500 sectors were positive, led by the beaten-up energy group.

Gains in Apple shares also lifted the indexes after the iPhone maker said it will reopen a handful of U.S. stores starting next week.

The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the Labor Department reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls diving by 22 million, but the decline still marked the steepest plunge since the Great Depression.

“It’s tough to call the jobs report, which is what everybody was waiting for, anything but a complete calamity, but relative to expectations you can see some silver linings in there,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, pointing to the large number of temporary layoffs.

“Except for the initial panic in the month of March, in general the markets are ignoring economic data for the most part and are looking more at data related to COVID-19,” Nick said.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.91% to end at 24,330.77 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.69%, to 2,929.77.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.58% to 9,121.32.

Financial markets on Thursday began pricing in a negative U.S. interest rate environment for the first time, as investors grappled with the economic consequences of the new coronavirus outbreak.

Stocks have staged a sharp rebound since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday erased its 2020 declines and turned positive for the year.

Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.

""People are watching closely to just see how this reopening process works,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services.

""On the margin, you are starting to hear businesses say that things are starting to look better from a depressed level.”

Optimism for markets was also fed by news that U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed their Phase 1 trade deal, with China saying they agreed to improve the atmosphere for its implementation.

U.S. market surges despite ""historic"" job losses in April

MUFG Union Bank Chief Financial Economist Chris Rupkey added that ""April might be it for job losses going forward"" as the U.S. begins reopen the economy and that a ""silver-lining"" in Friday's report might be included in the ""realization"" that the economy might not be this weak going forward.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-won-t-tolerate-technology-043601074.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T04:36:01+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ever since Donald Trump fired the first shot in the U.S. trade war with China, one technology company has been sitting in the middle, trying to avoid the crossfire. It’s wonderful to be able to sell weapons to all sides, until one forces you to choose.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is in the enviable position of being a critical supplier to both countries. The company, headquartered in famed Hsinchu Science Park, makes the world’s most advanced chips for the likes of Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co.

The U.S. fear, as portrayed by the White House, Pentagon and Commerce Department, is that allowing China to procure the world’s best semiconductors while America is unable to make them at home is an urgent and critical national security threat. That’s spurred a two-pronged strategy in recent years: Limit Chinese access to and development of chip technology, and bolster domestic prowess.

TSMC’s strategy has been to stay neutral. It has most of its capacity in Taiwan, one new and one not-so-new factory in China, and an old facility in Washington state.

A year ago, I wrote that chairman Mark Liu had politely pushed back against pressure to expand in America, citing the steep costs. I concluded: “TSMC won’t be able to sit on the fence forever. While Liu may want to just make chips, he’ll eventually have to make a choice.”

That day has come.

The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted Washington’s need to protect supply chains from disruption, and heightened concerns about reliance on Taiwan, as the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. To that end, the administration is pushing hard to get chipmakers, including Intel Corp., TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., to expand in the U.S., and to use their best technology, the WSJ wrote.

Unsurprisingly, Intel is making the case that the U.S. should strengthen its domestic production for “geopolitical” reasons. The company has most of its staff, and more than half its plants and equipment, in the U.S., including manufacturing in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon.

While best-known for supplying processors used in PCs and servers under its own name, Intel also operates a foundry business that does contract manufacturing using clients’ own designs. Once the world leader in chip production, the Santa Clara, California-based company has fallen behind and now trails TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.

Intel clearly sees an opportunity. If it can convince defense and commerce officials that it’s in the interest of national security to mandate that at least some chips be made domestically, then it may have a shot at getting back into the foundry game.

TSMC has been trying to push back, or at least to get a seat in the policy discussions. It recently hired former Intel lobbyist Peter Cleveland to coordinate its efforts in Washington. As the old saying goes, “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”

But the other aspect of American strategy may be harder for the Taiwanese company to negotiate. Beyond expanding domestic capacity, Washington wants to limit Chinese access. To do so, the Trump administration is considering new rules to curb the use of U.S. equipment and materials in making chips for the likes of Huawei, arguing that the Chinese company is a conduit for Beijing’s espionage.

That’s put TSMC and numerous other companies in a difficult position. The American market accounted for 59% of its sales last year, against 19% for Chinese clients. Yet the growth momentum clearly favors the world’s largest country, which is focused on developing components used in artificial intelligence, 5G communications, surveillance and possibly weaponry.

TSMC has attempted to play Switzerland. A year ago, the company was sticking with the line that “We are everybody’s foundry.”

Washington increasingly wants TSMC to be its foundry alone. Pressure has ramped up significantly over the past year, with the long list of U.S. clients and significant revenue contribution being used as a battering ram to make the point that America is the side to choose. Ten years ago, when Taipei-Beijing relations were friendlier, companies may have leaned toward China. Today, with China showing increasing belligerence and the U.S. supporting a greater global voice for Taiwan, the mood has shifted.

This video was recorded on May 1, 2020.

Chris Hill: We're going to begin, once again, with the big macro. Nearly 4 million Americans filed for unemployment this week, that brings the total to 30 million unemployed since the pandemic hit America. And yet, Andy Cross, somehow, April was the best month for the S&P 500 since 1987.

Andy Cross: Yeah, Chris, you really see those headlines, and then you see the stock performance in April and you just think there's just some disconnect with what investors are seeing. Now, we're still off in the highs, so clearly the COVID pandemic that is facing all of us continues to have that impact. So, we're down from the highs, but it's been a really nice rebound. Really, the April, which is pretty much across the board, energy was actually the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, but clearly tech and consumer are seeing a nice rebound as well. And you just look at the numbers, Chris, and you look at how each of us is interacting day-by-day and I just can't help but think, you continue to see this divide between the digitals haves and the digital have-nots and the companies that are really reacting well to the pandemic, and as we are using more Zoom and Google [Alphabet] solutions and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) solutions, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) solutions, much more digital solutions, those companies not just during the pandemic but also through the pandemic will continue to do well and thrive. And those that aren't, that are much more tied to the traditional economy are the ones that look like they're going to be the ones that are going to be long-term dragging behind. But clearly a lot of excitement in April with the news that's coming out about potentially improving and unlocking the economy longer term.

Jason Moser: Yeah, I mean, I don't think we've ever really made the argument that the market makes a lot of sense in the short-run, I mean, that's something we talk about all the time is that these near-term market behaviors aren't always so easy to fully make sense of. And that's why I think it really, really supports our argument of always be investing. I mean, it's just so difficult to try to figure out ways to get in and out of the market.

You would think maybe this would be a tumultuous time for the market, but here we are, obviously, it was one heck of a month, and I think part of that really just speaks to the source of all of this, really when it boils down to it. I mean, there is a finish line here. I mean, at some point, we will have this virus under control, whether that's in the form of treatments or whether that's in the form of vaccine. So, I mean, this isn't something where I think we're looking at ultimately a lost decade. I've had questions before about the Great Depression versus what's going on now. Let's remember the causes of the Great Depression. There were a number of causes and it's difficult to really pinpoint one thing there. We know the cause of this and we also know the ultimate solution of this. And it's just a matter of buying time.

And so, we've seen that our government is going to get in there and do what it can to provide the liquidity to buy us as much time as possible. And I think that's something to remember. But ultimately, there is a finish line; that's something to always keep in mind here. I think that's why the market is willing to give this thing a little bit more credit than perhaps we were thinking it might give at the beginning of the year.

Cross: You know, my comments about the energy market in April aside, we are now looking at a very concentrated market. More than 20% of the S&P's market cap is tied to five companies, five of the largest companies and you haven't really seen that since you have the dot-com craze of the late-90s and the 2000s. So, you're seeing a concentrated market. And that's sometimes a little bit scary for investors over the shorter term, I think.

So, I still think there's just uncertainty about how investors and algorithms can react to what is happening in the consumer business and businesses in general. But also, we can't forget all the trillions of dollars that the Federal reserve is pumping into the economy to keep things humming along.

Hill: Alright. Let's get to some earnings and we're going to start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Shares of Amazon down more than 7% on Friday after first quarter sales came in north of $75 billion, but the higher than expected sales came with Amazon's statement that it plans to spend all profits from the second quarter responding to the pandemic. And, Jason, anyone who has watched Jeff Bezos for a while cannot be surprised by this.

Moser: No. You can't be surprised at all. This is much of the same here. The retail business continues to impress, 27% growth in revenue, overall revenue excluding currency effects, and I think what we're really seeing, though, beyond the growth in Amazon's business, another word they mentioned in the release and something they talked about in the call, that's the durability of this business. We're at a point now, like it or not, this is a business that really needs to exist. And I think it goes to show the value and thinking the way that Jeff Bezos does. The way he's always thought about this business in such long time frames, that's starting to pay off now far beyond just the growth of the business and the durability of the business, the importance of this business.

But if we dig down into the results there, I think one of the encouraging aspects of the business, here we talk a lot about, Amazon Web Services, that hit $10 billion in sales for the quarter. They boosted the operating margin there to 30% versus 28.8% a year ago. And just to go back to that point you were noting there earlier, just so we can get some clarification there for listeners, so they understand exactly what was said there in the release. And I'm going to just go ahead and read the quote real quick so it makes sense.

They say in the release, ""If you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we're not thinking small. Under normal circumstances, and this coming quarter too, we'd expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit. But these aren't normal circumstances, instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion and perhaps a bit more on COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.""

Again, the durability of the business allows them to think this way, and as a shareowner, listen, I'm not taking a seat, I'm standing up and applauding this move because I really like it.

Hill: Apple's second quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. And, Andy, we can also add Apple to the short list of companies raising their dividend in this environment.

Cross: Very short list, Chris. It was actually a pretty good result considering that China sales were down 8% during the quarter, announcing, like you mentioned, it's going to increase its dividend by 6% and authorize another $50 billion in share buybacks. Revenues were up 1%, slightly ahead of estimates. Maybe it was $58 billion down from the $63 billion that they were expecting before the COVID-19 pandemic really started to hit.

Product sales were down 4%, that's including a 7% drop in iPhones. Now, less than 50% of total sales versus 53% last quarter. Services continues to be the bright spot for Apple as we've talked about time and time again that those revenues were up almost 17% and now make up 23% of the sales versus 20% of the sales last quarter. A really strong January, but then the COVID pandemic started to hit and dent February and March.

So, overall, really pretty nice quarter for Apple considering what was happening in China then what would really happen in February and March of this year. They now have 515 million paid subscriptions across all of their services. That was up by 125 million from a year ago or more than 30% growth and they'll cross that 600 million mark this calendar year, which is what they expected. And Wearables, Home and Accessories were at $6.3 billion, Chris, that was up 23%.

So, really, I think that you look at Apple and you say, wow! Yes, they were really hit hard by what happened in China and they're starting to see some slowdown, but overall, pretty nice quarter.

Hill: Well, and we've talked about this before, one of the things that Apple's enormous pile of cash affords it is the patience to see segments like Wearables and Services pay off, because there was a point in time where those were a tiny fraction of what Apple was doing every quarter in terms of their business. And this latest report, it's roughly $20 billion.

Cross: Yeah, it actually continues to be the bright spot for Apple. Now, the iPhone is such a key part to their ecosystem, so when those sales are down overall there is some concern there, but I think a lot of that was just considering the environment that we're in and there's maybe some hope that there's a lot of pent-up demand when you look out over the next 12 to 18-months as we begin to continue to go and shop in those stores that we'll see some bright spots on the iPhone sales.

They did flag some challenges with advertising and Apple Care for June, so that's something to watch.

Hill: Let's move to the War on Cash, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reporting this week. Mastercard's first quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Similar story for Visa's second quarter results. And, Jason, both stocks up this week.

Moser: Yeah, I mean, in regard to Visa, you know, this is not just the card that's in your wallet company anymore, they're really focused on this massive new flows segment of the business, this opportunity that they refer to as new flows. And ultimately, this is focusing on everything from business-to-business -- and that's big business and small business -- person-to-person, business-to-consumer, even government-to-consumer. And particularly now, government-to-consumer, we're finding that to be a bit more relevant these days, but all-in-all it totals $185 trillion opportunity of money moving around the world. And that's really where Visa and Mastercard are also headed with their networks.

And I think it's important to really stress the value of that network there, they're facilitating the movement of this money. But when we look at Visa, revenue was up 8% for the quarter, excluding currency effects. They now have $3.5 billion cards issued in total. They did withdraw guidance simply because it's too nebulous at this point. But again, it's not just consumer payments, it's everything from consumers to business to governments.

The long-term tailwinds, though, you do have to love. I mean, money continues to move around. Looking at some specific relationships. They renewed their relationship with Square. I think it's really important for people to recognize that Visa and Square, these are two businesses that like each other. Their success, you know, that begets success both ways and you're seeing value play out in this Visa Direct platform, which is ultimately leveraging that network to get money pretty much anywhere fast at this point.

I did think it was interesting, the disparity in the share repurchase philosophy between the two companies. Mastercard, they're sort of diplomatically suspending at this point, that'll be temporary nature.

But Visa, really, they are, kind of, putting their foot on the gas. They bought back 17.8 million shares for around $3.2 billion for the quarter. They have a plan to buyback over $9 billion in stock this fiscal year. That absolutely remains unchanged, because they don't see this COVID-19 crisis as something that is fundamentally challenging to the long-term nature of the business. Money still has to get from point A. to point B. and I think they're really showing the value in that network there. I suspect they'll be set up for many, many good years to come.

Hill: Shares of Alphabet up this week after first quarter revenue came in higher than expected. And, Andy, this seems like one of those situations where the comments from leadership is what drove the stock more than the results.

Cross: Yeah, Chris, I think expectations are pretty muted, because there's been talks from the CEO and from the company about hiring freezes and pullback in some of the spending. But overall, pretty nice. Revenues up 13%. Operating income down a little bit, when you account for the $1.7 billion European Commission fine from last year. But like you mentioned, the commentary is really what's important.

Performance was strong during the first two months of the quarter, but then in March it really pulled back. Sundar Pichai, the CEO, talked about a tale of two quarters, so that strong beginning is really tough at the end. Ruth Porat, she's very conservatively, I really like what she's brought, a lot of discipline to the financial picture, she's a CFO. She talked about -- we anticipate a second quarter that will be a difficult one for the advertising business. A lot of excitement around search with COVID terms, but they don't know how much that will monetize. Still a very well-run company. 100 million students and educators now are using Google Classrooms. That's double just from what they saw at the beginning of March.

Hill: Aaron, really quick before we get to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) latest results. How are you thinking about the disconnect between what's happening in the market and what's happening in the economy?

Aaron Bush: Yeah, I think what the guy said earlier, I mostly agree with. I think we just see a confluence of lots of different factors right now. The market is forward-thinking. The mix of what companies have become a larger percentage of the markets or a smaller percentage, that has changed. [laughs] The trillions in dollars in stimulus helps. People still need a place to put their money, and obviously, things are still playing out and it's going to get better for some, worse than others, but the disconnect is real, but I think, over time, we'll start to see things connect back in a more logical way.

Hill: You know, Facebook's first quarter results seemed a lot like Alphabet's, you know their ad revenue fell in March, it sort of stabilized in April and that stock is up nearly 10% this week.

Bush: Yeah. I mean, on the consumption layer, things are holding up really well. They have 2.6 billion monthly active users, over 1.7 billion coming daily. So, the Facebook platforms are more relevant than ever. Now, on the business front, results held up pretty well. Revenue was up 17%. Record free cash flow. Obviously, some of that came before the worst of the economic crisis hit, but still this is a business that has held up really well. And I think a lot of it, you can point to some patterns where brand advertising has fallen off, but Facebook has a really strong direct response advertising business where people pay or companies pay for specific consumer responses. And so, a lot of companies have filled those voids when ad prices have fallen. Lots of stronger companies, like, e-commerce companies or gaming companies have really stepped up and have started spending more.

And Mark Zuckerberg has been pretty clear and saying that he still sees pretty major opportunities. Facebook is continuing to hire, they're continuing to spend in order to capture opportunity, both, in attracting more users, improving their core platforms, adding more products and making sure that Facebook is doing its part to help the world battle this ongoing pandemic.

So, Facebook, it still is a pretty noisy business and it still will get a lot of criticism, but there still is a lot of reason to be bullish when you look under the covers and see how strong this business is performing.

Hill: Let's move to food and beverage. Andy, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) first quarter, same sort of thing, results were good early in the quarter, fell off as COVID-19 hit and I'm just struck by the fact that this is a global restaurant, more than half of McDonald's international restaurants are closed right now.

Cross: Chris, you got that right, we need to talk about that, the two different kinds of quarters. In January and February, global comps were up 7.2% and they finished down 3.4% versus a growth of 5.4% last quarter. Global comps are down 22% in March. So, you can really see the impact. Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, relatively new CEO, talked about January February sales doing really well. But then we saw this with the restaurant closures, limited operations, and what they call dramatic changes in customer behavior, leading them to withdraw their 2020 guidance and really cut their CapEx spending. Looking forward, operating cash flow will be much lower for the year.

So, they continue to do what you have to do when you're running that kind of store and it's $100 billion market cap company. Huge company. 40,000 stores, but obviously, it's a tough go in the face of this pandemic.

Hill: Aaron, Starbucks, the global same-store sales were down 10% in the second quarter, and Kevin Johnson, the CEO, he's working to open every store in America by early June. And I don't want to gloss over the earnings report, but this is going to be interesting to watch.

Bush: Yeah, it definitely will be interesting to watch. My hunch is that the numbers were bad this quarter, next quarter will get even worse, but this really is the type of situation where, similar to McDonald's, like, you can't extrapolate what's going on right now too much. Like, as a long-term investor you still need to kind of go back to the basics and recognize Starbucks as a great brand, when times normalize, it will reaccelerate new store openings, openings of existing stores. It still has pricing power, [laughs] it has a great digital presence. So, all of these factors -- it sucks in the short-term, but in the long-run, all of those same factors still exist and point to Starbucks being a business that can turn itself around.

Hill: Shares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) went down a bit despite good results in the first quarter, Jason. I mean, it seems like this was a little bit of the reverse of what we saw with Google and Facebook. Twitter executives definitely are not saying that the worst is behind them, in part because of live events. Live events helped drive engagement on Twitter. And the executives at Twitter were pretty upfront about the impact they're feeling there.

Moser: Yeah. I mean, it was a mixed bag, I think is fair to say. It certainly feels like Twitter has the opportunity here to meaningfully grow its audience as it's being seen as a source of information right now as opposed to really entertainment. Though there is a lot of entertaining stuff out there right now, Chris.

I think the real question, though, is can they keep that audience? And we're going to have to just wait and see there, but in regard to the numbers. That monetizable daily active user number reached 166 million for the quarter, that was up 24% from a year ago, that marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth there, so that's good. Revenue of $808 million represented 3% growth. That wasn't bad. They had a pretty good quarter, but they really did show the impact of coronavirus. From March 11th until March 31st, total advertising revenue actually declined about 27%. And I don't think they're really out of the woods there yet.

They are going to have some capital expenditures ramping up here in the year, as their aim to build a data center is going to be pushed back a little bit due to supply chain constraints there. So, they're going to be spending a little bit more money and, of course, guidance is still somewhat nebulous as well. The balance sheet remains a point of strength. They have $7.7 billion in cash and short-term investments there. So, they're going to be buying back some shares.

And, again, it seems like they keep on recording these mixed bag quarters. I think it's just a matter of finding out, can they really grow that audience and keep the audience and then meaningfully monetize that audience. They just continue to have trouble doing that on a sustainable basis, but this is certainly a point of time where they have that opportunity as it's being seen as a platform of information, and right now that's valuable.

Hill: First quarter revenue for Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) rose 22%, and Spotify now has 130 million paid subscribers. Aaron, really seems like there's a lot to like in this quarter.

Bush: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty impressed with what Spotify is putting up right now. To be clear though, I don't think that Spotify is a fantastic business yet, but I think it's doing a lot of solid work that will make it a much better business in the future. So, as you mentioned, they continue to amass a ton of active users and then convert them into paying subscribers. So, they now have 286 million monthly active users and 130 million of those are now paying.

And even though there's a lot of competition out there, it's pretty clear to me that Spotify is the one who, one, is innovating the most, and two, is becoming the aggregator of all audio in general. They threw out a couple of interesting stats. 70% of users who churn out, come back within 45 days. I thought that was impressive, and then, podcast listening has also been a bright spot, which is also more profitable for them, it's growing. And 70% of new podcasts that are put on Spotify are made on Anchor, which Spotify purchased last year.

So, from a strategy standpoint and a user standpoint, things are looking really strong. Revenue growth of 22% is good. It's not as strong as user growth due to heavy free trials, but I think that there is reason to think that it can go steadily high like this for a few more years. They also expect to be free cash flow positive for the year. And even though music isn't that profitable of a business to be in, if they're successful in aggregating all of audio as a whole, the room for profitability goes much higher. So, even though Spotify isn't a perfect business today, I like what I'm seeing them do right now and I think that they're setting the groundwork to be a much better business in the future.

Hill: On a related note, I'll just add that anyone on Spotify can get all five of the Motley Fool's podcasts as part of their offering there. So, check that out if you're on Spotify.

Let's go back to big tech. Microsoft shares up a bit this week after third quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. And, Jason, I feel like we say this every quarter, the Azure cloud business just continuing to get it done.

Moser: It really is. You're right, I think similar to what we were talking about with Amazon earlier, what's so impressive with Microsoft at this point in the game, it's the durability of this business. The fact that it is so important and it plays such a big role in everything that we do, they talked about it on the call, this realization of the digital economy, they're seeing essentially two years of digitization being pulled forward into two months due to conditions on the ground. And I think the continued efforts on the part of Satya Nadella to continue to invest in that cloud business, it's clearly paying off.

If you look at the overall results, $35 billion in revenue, up 15% from a year ago. Even more impressive, that operating income number grew 25%, that brought it down to the bottom-line. 23% growth in earnings per share. But back to the cloud business, that intelligent cloud segment of the business revenue at $12.3 billion, that was up 29%, thanks to that Azure revenue growth of 61%. So, yeah, you said it there, the Azure platform continues to get it done.

And I tell you, on a separate note there, you could see in the call, this really does seem like a moment for Microsoft Teams. I mean, it does seem like, in a world driven by headlines of Slack and Zoom, Microsoft Teams is starting to step up their game and you're seeing some really impressive numbers beyond just those user numbers, but just the partnerships that they're forming, the educational institutions that are depending on that platform, the NFL, big companies like Accenture and Pfizer and SAP, it's not going to be the biggest revenue driver, but again, I think it goes back to the durability of this business, the need for this business. And I think this was another quarter that really reemphasized that.

Hill: You know, I'm reminded of the fact that one of the reasons Bill Gates was so successful in leading Microsoft in the 80s and 90s was his willingness to abandon projects that had a lot of sunk costs, a lot of resource hours thrown at them, Microsoft would invest one, two years in a given initiative and then if Gates felt like it wasn't working, they'd walk away from it, they would just drop it and move on to something else. Teams does not seem like one of those things, it really feels like Microsoft is going to stick with Teams for a while.

Moser: Yeah, I tend to agree. And just as someone who's fiddled around with Teams before, I think it's a really great platform. I found a lot of use out of it, and honestly, I wish we'd use it here more at Fool HQ, but we are where we are today and that's just fine. I do like the bets they're making on that side of the business, though, for sure.

Hill: Aaron, one of the things Microsoft talked about with this latest quarter was more engagement with Xbox, not surprising, as everyone is trapped inside their homes. No one knows more about the gaming industry that I know than you. Where are we right now with the gaming industry, because it seems like every time I read something about it, people are talking about how the holidays at the end of this year are the key to everything. Is that really the case?

Bush: I think the holidays will be important, because Microsoft's new Xbox system, Sony's new PlayStation system are coming out this holiday season. So, there's a lot of hype around that, but I don't think it's as revolutionary as a lot of people think that it is. It definitely is a big deal for the gaming community, but from like a business perspective, I think other things, perhaps, are more important. I mean, with the console specifically, we will see demand, for sure. Like, it'll benefit these companies, it might benefit some retailers, it's not the type of thing that's going to save GameStop, whichever [...] on about before. But it will be beneficial. But I also wonder just if there's high unemployment if these console prices are much higher than in past generations, will it lead to a similar explosion out of the gate? I'm not sure.

But also, I think it's important to put two other things in perspective. One, is that mobile gaming is a much bigger deal than it used to be. It's the biggest and fastest growing category of gaming. So, that's not something that is strictly reliant on the holiday season like a new console launch is. And so, big parts of the gaming industry humming along just fine. And then second, [laughs] I think in a normal year, the holiday season is more important, but this is not a normal year at all. And we've seen pretty tremendous results and crazy stats around how videogame engagement, both, in terms of people playing games and watching other people play games, is higher than [laughs] it's ever been by far, e-sports is legitimizing it at faster pace than I think anybody could have expected. We're seeing records broken for, like, digital unit sales of games. So, there's a lot going on right now that is exciting that has nothing to do with the consoles coming up, which are exciting in their own way, but the industry is a lot bigger than just Xbox's new console coming out.

Hill: Last thing before we move on. We've certainly seen it in the entertainment industry that movie production, television production is being halted for all the obvious reasons. Is this affecting video game production for companies like Activision Blizzard, Take-Two and the rest or are they basically proceeding?

Bush: It definitely is affecting them. On the consumption layer, again, like, with what users were doing, it's hitting record highs. But these companies are having to figure out what every single other company in the world is having to figure out, how to work remotely, how to ship results when everybody isn't working with each other the same way. We already have seen some game delays, we'll probably see some more, but I'm optimistic that this is something that companies will figure out and this won't stay an issue forever.

Hill: First quarter revenue for Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) came in higher than expected. Shares of the telehealth company are down this week, but, Jason, even with the drop, Teladoc has doubled in 2020.

Moser: Yeah, it's certainly been a very good year for the business, and I think that's for obvious reasons. It was a good quarter, we kind of knew that already with their preannounce a little while back, but for me, it was really the full year guidance that tells the real story and put a little context around that.

Previously, management had targeted a range of $695 million to $710 million in revenue for 2020. The most recent street average bumped that number $737 million. As of this release now, management now sees a range of $800 million to $825 million in revenue for the year, and that's pretty much all organic growth at this point. So, I think it's safe to say that we have now bought into the merits of telemedicine as a part of our overall healthcare system.

But if we look at the numbers for the quarter, total U.S. paid members grew 61%. Visit fee-only members grew 89%. Total visits almost fully doubled from a year ago. The acquisition of this InTouch Health business will also help diversify their revenue stream and their customer base, as they ultimately start working on supporting hospital customers, looking to establish or expand their telemedicine offerings.

They foresee U.S. paid members at the end of the year of at least 50 million members, that would be 36% growth from a year ago. Again, visit fee-only access, which is a nice way to get your foot in the door, that'll be around 20 million individuals. And they are calling for total visits of 8 million to 9 million, which would be a total visit growth of around 90% to 100% over the prior year.

So, the numbers are all telling a tale here. I think it's important to note all of this guidance, this is all forecast based on no resurgence of the virus here in the back-half of the year. Now, of course, we hope there is no resurgence, but the point is, that it's a fairly conservative forecast in that regard. And so, I think it all just leads us back to this notion that Teladoc Health is one company out there certainly benefiting from this idea that telemedicine can be a nice value-add to our overall healthcare system here, not only nationally, but really globally, and I think that's where Teladoc Health shines. It is a comprehensive and global network and it's continuing to grow like gangbusters.

Hill: Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), the enterprise cloud software company out with third quarter results on Thursday afternoon. Aaron, when I think of Atlassian and the way that they develop collaboration software, this also seems like an environment where Atlassian would do even better.

Bush: Yeah, maybe surprisingly, it was a pretty boring quarter for Atlassian, which in today's world is a pretty great thing. They sell collaboration workflow software which is as relevant as it ever has been. I don't necessarily think it's more relevant or less relevant now that people are working remotely, but it still is a critical function to the way people work in the vast majority of industries. And the company's low-touch marketing, where no one has to interact with the sales rep to get onboarded and ramps up with their products and services, that is perfectly suited for today's environment, in particular.

So, this is a company that doesn't have too much to worry about and it shows in the results. The company added over 6,000 new customers this quarter. Revenue rose 33% and that was driven primarily by a 47% increase in subscription revenue. The company is still spitting out free cash flow, which kind of goes back to that low-touch marketing model, that's just a lower cost for the business to run. They have $2 billion in cash. They're still hiring. So, this is a business where things are still going well.

If there is anything different to note, though, about this quarter, it's that Atlassian is offering up free cloud-based solutions to a bunch of new companies or those who are trying to transition away from on-premise work. That free component won't go on forever. And there is a short-term cost to it, but that represents the type of long-term thinking that I like to see in the companies that I own. So, Atlassian is doing good. And that type of effort that they're putting in to help companies will build loyalty over time.

So, all-in-all, I mean, Atlassian, they're doing exactly what anyone, any investor would want to see from them as a shareholder. There's a chance that growth slows a little bit as companies are slower to make types of big decisions around tools, purchasing decisions. Right now, they are focused on other things, but looking out longer term, absolutely nothing has changed about this business.

Hill: Atlassian has a bunch of different types of software in their portfolio, is there one in particular that really helps drive business more so than the others?

Bush: I think Jira, which is kind of like a workflow tool, is their biggest and most important. It was their first product that they made. But really, what drives Atlassian is, obviously, bringing people into those products, but they also have a really good approach to knowing when to build something new, when to buy something new and when to partner with someone. Like, they shut down some of their services in exchange for equity in Slack.

Hill: Time to get to the stocks on our radar, and our man, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question.

Andy, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?

Cross: Chris, I'm looking at Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). Tyson Chairman, John Tyson warned this week that the food supply chain is breaking with millions of pounds of beef being lost from slaughterhouses closing and processing facilities closing. So, I'm taking a look at Beyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitute, like, its very popular Beyond Burger. Personally, I'm a fan of the beyond sausages, but it sells these plant burgers and meats in grocery stores like Whole Foods. It reports earnings next week, has partnerships with McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, it will start offering it's Beyond Beef in China for the first time through its partnership with Starbucks.

It's a $6 billion market cap, one of the hottest IPOs of the year and the stock is down to below $100 from $235 last year. Founder and CEO, Ethan Brown owns 2.5%. So, I'm really interested to see what they are talking about with the food supply chain issues that we've been hearing about for the past couple of months in the face of the COVID pandemic.

Hill: And the ticker?

Cross: BYND.

Hill: Dan, question about Beyond Meat?

Dan Boyd: Sure, Chris. Andy, let's fast forward to November real quick. Thanksgiving is coming up, are you buying a Beyond Meat turkey?

Cross: [laughs] Well, since my family doesn't really eat a whole lot of meat, if they had a Beyond Meat turkey, knowing my fan for the Beyond Meat burger and the sausage, I would definitely take a look at it.

Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at?

Moser: Yeah, taking a look at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Ticker MDT. You know, I'm a big fan of healthcare and immersive technology, and Medtronic, it's kind of like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich there, Chris, it's firing on both cylinders. It's a global medical device company with a long history of innovation. You probably saw in the news recently, they actually made the design and code for its portable ventilator available for all to use in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, which I just thought was really, really nice to see, but they have more than 80 extended reality projects under way across the company, from their diabetes division also, even using extended reality programs to help train the best way to insert glucose sensors. So, this is just a company I think is really doing a lot of cool stuff. Looking forward to earnings later this month.

Hill: Dan, question about Medtronic?

Boyd: Alright, Jason, if you can augment one of your senses, what are you going with and why?

Moser: Ooh! Augment one of my senses? Man, I feel like I'd have to augment my hearing, because I love music so much and you can just feel it.

Hill: Aaron Bush, we got less than a minute what are you looking at?

Bush: I'm going to DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), ticker DOCU. So, there's been a lot of discussion about companies like Zoom and Teladoc lately, but DocuSign is another company that in my mind is just so obviously a more important part of the digital future, it was important before the pandemic hit, but it's accelerating what's going on with the e-signature business.

And what's great about DocuSign is that like Zoom, it is the verb, it is the word for e-signature. Two, it has a massive runaway left, and then three, it has some good optionality. So, it's a $19 billion business, but it's a lot smaller than the Atlassian, Zooms and Adobes of the world.

Hill: Dan?

Boyd: Aaron, this week we talked on our podcast about DocuSign getting bought by Adobe, what are your thoughts, still interested if they do?

Bush: I think they're almost too big, but maybe worth a shot.

Hill: What do you have in your watchlist, Dan?

Boyd: I'm going with my man, J. Moe, and Medtronic.

Moser: That's three in a row, baby. Hey, now.

Hill: Alright. Thanks for being here, guys. We're out of time. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening, we'll see you next week."

The coronavirus stock market rally has come a long way from March lows. The Nasdaq is not far from all-time highs, led by Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big techs.

ServiceNow stock and Microsoft stock are in buy zones now. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are setting up new entries, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are closing in on buy points.

But is the stock market rally disconnected from the grim economic reality? That may not be the right question for investors.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value, but off their worst levels. S&P 500 futures sank 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.3%. In the coronavirus stock market rally, Dow Jones futures have been less volatile than during the market crash. But Dow futures can still show some notable swings.

Stock Market Rally Disconnect From Economic Reality?

Many argue that there's a disconnect between the coronavirus stock market rally from the economic reality of a massive recession and joblessness. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and will shed millions more in May. Unemployment is expected to top 20% at a minimum. There are some positive signs while states and countries are starting to open up, but until there's a vaccine much of the economy will be in a lower gear or shut down entirely.

So is the coronavirus stock market rally divorced from reality? Let's take a closer look.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Winners

The big stock market rally winners during the coronavirus crisis aren't a surprise. Many are just outright coronavirus plays: Zoom Video (ZM), Moderna (MRNA), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Peloton Interactive (PTON), along with Netflix stock, Amazon stock and Shopify stock.

Meanwhile, AMD stock, Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock, Nvidia (NVDA), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and many others — especially software — are benefiting in various ways from the stay-at-home trend, helping people hold up or even thrive in the coronavirus crisis.

Further down, there are internet giants Facebook stock and Google stock as well as digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL). Facebook and Google are seeing strong demand from people stuck at home. PayPal is benefiting from people adopting digital payments. Facebook stock, Google stock and PayPal stock may do especially well in a world of continued social distancing but with a recovery in advertising and consumer spending.

Likewise, Apple stock and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) have broken out. Apple and Lululemon are upscale consumer discretionary companies. In the midst of a deep recession where people have been stuck at home, status-enhancing discretionary purchases would seem at risk. But, to be blunt, many people who buy Apple and Lululemon products haven't lost their well-paying jobs. If these consumers feel confident that the economy will improve, they're willing to spend today.

Also, some medicals are doing well, seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, such as Dexcom (DXCM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Finally, a few consumer products companies like Clorox (CLX) and General Mills (GIS) were plodding along before the coronavirus crisis but have seen demand spike for cleaning products, cereal and soup.

So there's a good argument for all of these stocks to be doing well. In other words, the leading stocks in the coronavirus market rally don't seem disconnected from their companies' reality.

Given the heft of Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Netflix stock, Amazon stock, Nvidia stock, AMD stock, Facebook stock, Google stock, PayPal stock, Shopify stock, ServiceNow stock, along with many other coronavirus market rally winners, it's easy to see why the Nasdaq composite is doing so well.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Losers

Meanwhile, plenty of ""real economy"" market sectors have been badly hit: travel, leisure, energy, manufacturing and many retailers and financials. Many of these sectors are shut down.

Most of these companies were struggling before the coronavirus with beaten-down stocks. The market cap on many of these stocks is fairly low. Macy's (M), the nation's largest department store chain, has a market cap of $1.55 billion. Contrast that to Microsoft stock, with a market cap of $1.38 trillion. So solid advances by megacap techs such as Microsoft, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock can offset much bigger losses by companies with lower valuations.

Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, with more ""real economy"" stocks than the Nasdaq, have made far less progress in the coronavirus stock market rally.

Keep in mind that the stock market is made up of major companies, with most ""small-cap stocks"" small relative to the giants, but still fairly substantial operations. The stock market is not a microcosm of the overall economy, with the millions of truly small businesses struggling to survive.

Yes, The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Is Surprising

All that being said, it is surprising to see the stock market rally so quickly toward highs, even setting aside the economy. The old saying is that markets fall on an elevator and rise on an escalator. But the current stock market rally has run up almost as fast as the market crash.

The fact that the U.S. economy is suffering a historic contraction amid a still active pandemic makes the pace of the stock market rally even more surprising.

Follow, Don't Fight The Stock Market

But you want to pay attention to what the stock market is doing right now. Don't try to impose your opinions on it. The stock market doesn't care what you or I think.

Perhaps the market will re-evaluate the economic and earnings outlook to the downside, via a grim economic report, big corporate warning or a spike in coronavirus cases.

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock market move sideways for several weeks or pull back, at least somewhat.

Then again, maybe the stock market rally will surge into new high ground and beyond.

No matter what happens, if you're following the coronavirus market rally via the major indexes and leading stocks, you'll be ready to move with the stock market trend. Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Top Stocks To Watch

Microsoft stock, AMD stock, ServiceNow stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is Apple stock, which is modestly extended. Meanwhile, Facebook stock, AMD stock and Apple stock are on SwingTrader.

NFLX stock, FB stock, AMD stock and NOW stock are all IBD 50 members, along with several other stock market rally winners cited above.

Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

ServiceNow Stock

ServiceNow stock fell 4.7% to 365.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading. NOW stock is still above the 363.05 cup-base buy point. A pullback toward the buy point is normal, especially with race-from-the-bottom cup patterns.

The relative strength line for ServiceNow stock is still near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ServiceNow stock can be bought now, or perhaps at 388.60, just above Monday's all-time high.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock fell 2.3% to 182.51. MSFT stock is in range from a 180.10 handle on a double-bottom base. The RS line for Microsoft stock is at record highs.

Microsoft stock has the largest valuation of any U.S.-listed company. It just edges out Apple stock, which is at $1.35 trillion. Amazon stock follows at $1.18 trillion and Google stock at $939 billion.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock sank 2% to 431.82. NFLX stock is extended from an April breakout, but has been consolidating for a few weeks. It's not long enough for a proper base, but 449.62 could serve as an entry point for Netflix stock. A stock market rally pause or pullback could offer more time for NFLX stock to form a traditional consolidation.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock sank 2.2% to 2,356.95. Like Netflix stock, AMZN stock has been consolidating for a few weeks, though the e-commerce and cloud-computing services giant popped to a record 1,475 on April 30 just before earnings. Amazon stock fell on the earnings miss and weak guidance, but has remained in its recent range. A move above the old high would offer an entry point for Amazon stock.

AMD Stock

AMD stock sank 3.55%. The chipmaker is working on a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. AMD stock recently lagged some other data-center chipmakers, such as Nvidia stock and Inphi (IPHI), but may be perking up again. AMD earnings per share surged 300% and 200% in the last two quarters.

Facebook Stock

Facebook stock dipped 1.4% to 210.10. FB stock is steadily moving toward a V-shape consolidation with a 224.30 buy point. The relative strength line for Facebook stock has ramped up sharply in the last few weeks. Facebook stock once again on Tuesday was a ""Blue Dot"" stock, signifying stocks in bases with RS lines at new highs. They are identified on MarketSmith charts with a blue-shaded dot at the end of their RS lines.

A coronavirus stock market rally pause could offer a chance for Facebook stock to build a handle.

Google Stock

Google stock fell 2% to 1,375.18. A cup base with a 1,530.84 buy point has formed for GOOGL stock. Google stock, like FANG peer Facebook's stock, is a Blue Dot special today.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Monday, consolidating after recent gains as investors consider the risk of a resurgence in the coronavirus as lockdowns are lifted.

At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 1.6%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 22 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract fell 144 points, or 0.6%.

Wall Street posted its first winning week in three last week, overlooking Friday’s 20.5 million job losses which sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7 per cent, by far the worst number seen since the Great Depression.

Leading the gains have been the country’s tech giants. The Nasdaq 100 index is now just over 5% off its all time high, despite the grim economic news.

Boosting the general optimism of late has been the idea that the American economy is reopening - California, Michigan, and Ohio, three of the important states for U.S. manufacturing, have taken steps to allow factories and some businesses to resume work.

However, the news out of South Korea, earlier Friday, of a new spike in cases has prompted concerns as the East Asian nation has been praised globally for its efforts in curbing the virus.

The United States has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths in the pandemic, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, although aggregate numbers for Europe are still higher.

In the corporate sector, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock was up over 9% premarket following a report that linked Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to the world’s largest cinema chain, which has faced difficulties given the economic shutdown.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 3.4% premarket after the electric carmaker’s boss Elon Musk said it had filed a lawsuit against Alameda County in California, after the county’s health department had refused to let the Tesla factory reopen Friday. Musk added he may move the electric carmaker's headquarters out of California.

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will also be in focus after its Shanghai Disneyland park reopened at 30% of capacity Monday, a first small step to restoring one of the group's biggest profit machines.

Oil futures slipped back Monday, consolidating after recent gains had pushed the sector from the all-time lows seen recently. Last week the oil market also posted its first winning week in three.

At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 1.7% lower at $24.32 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.5% to $30.20.

Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,701.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0817, down 0.2%.

The social media giant is going after Zoom with the launch of Messenger Rooms, a free videoconferencing platform that supports as many as 50 participants at one time. With millions of people sheltering in place and working from home becoming the new normal, whoever wins in the videoconferencing market stands to benefit over the long run. Even if Facebook doesn't make money off of it, the data it can glean can help influence future products.

It's early in the game for Facebook, which has stumbled before with new product launches and has failed to break into the enterprise market like Zoom has. But with a ton of cash, more engaged users because of the pandemic, and a stated goal of leading in video, the tech stock may have a shot at displacing Zoom.

Facebook was already pursuing video

Prior to the pandemic, Facebook had been eyeing video as one of its next bastions of growth. That's taking on more urgency amid COVID-19.

Facebook views video in three distinct categories: video calling, video room, and live video where events are streamed in real-time. Video chat is driving a lot of the growth, with more than 700 million people participating in calls daily. Facebook expects that to increase now that it's doubling the number of possible participants in WhatsApp video calls to eight people. Live video is also growing with live events across the world called off. Facebook said more than 800 million daily active users are engaging with live streams on its platforms during the pandemic.

As for video rooms, Facebook is just getting its Zoom alternative off the ground. It's banking on Messenger Rooms resonating the same way the other video offerings have.

What sets Facebook's offering apart

With Messenger Rooms, users create a room and send friends a link to join. They can also list their rooms on Facebook, enabling drop-in visits. The video conferences are free and Facebook isn't putting any caps on the amount of time conferences last.

Messenger Rooms is launching first on Facebook and through Messenger, and will eventually land on Instagram Direct, WhatsApp, and Portal, its videoconferencing device. Once that happens, potentially billions of people will have access to this free videoconferencing tool. After all, Facebook boasts 2.6 billion monthly active users across its platforms. The more they're engaged, the more advertisers will be willing to spend with Facebook to reach that audience and hopefully land them as customers.

Facebook is also trying to differentiate Messenger Rooms from Zoom by requiring no commitment on the part of meeting participants. There's no app to download, and participants aren't required to become a Facebook user to take part in a virtual meeting. That presents an opportunity for Facebook to cheaply target people who aren't on the social media platform. Just one meeting may be all it takes to land a new user.

A rocky history in the business market

Free customers, although they may become Facebook users, aren't what the social media giant needs to really displace Zoom. It has to win over corporations, which may not be that easy if its history provides any evidence.

A few years back the social media giant set its sights on displacing Slack (NYSE:WORK) with Workplace, but its offering failed to take off in the same way Slack did. In October, Facebook said 3 million users were paying for its service -- just half of the 6 million paying customers Slack had at the time.

In a high-profile blow to Facebook's efforts to break into the corporate market, CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, announced in late January that it was ending its trial of Workplace, citing changes the service's pricing. With Facebook now going after free Zoom users, rather than paying ones, it's not clear how Messenger Rooms will help it branch further into the enterprise market.

Facebook has the cash to take on Zoom

Facebook does have a ton of cash it can pour into the effort, ending the first quarter with $60.29 billion, up 33% year over year. Since then, the company spent $5.7 billion to purchase India's Jio Platforms and $5 billion to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices. That still leaves a sizable chunk to spend on product launches and enhancements including video.

Just because Facebook has clear advantages over Zoom doesn't mean the contest will be smooth sailing for the social media giant. Facebook doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to protecting customers' privacy, which could prevent people from using Messenger Rooms. Zoom has its own troubles on that front, but questions about Facebook's ability and desire to protect user data have long roiled lawmakers, privacy groups, and regulators.

Facebook is trying to assuage those concerns, vowing not to watch or listen to audio or video calls whether they originate from a Facebook customer or someone joining the call as a guest. To prevent hackers from infiltrating a room, Facebook is using links composed of a random combination of characters, digits, letters, and numbers.

If Messenger Rooms manifests the same security issues that hurt Zoom, it may fail to usurp Zoom's leadership status. But if it succeeds, there's a real chance Facebook could be the one to knock Zoom off its perch. Gaining the top spot in videoconferencing could give Facebook a new way to diversify its business, keep users engaged, land new ones who enjoy the Messenger Rooms experience, and leave advertisers clamoring for access to its platforms -- all of which would likely bode well for its bottom line and its stock."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jonathan-angrist-cognios-t-deliver-003110815.html,AAPL,2020-05-11T00:31:10+00:00,"Investing is hard. It used to be very easy. Hedge funds in the 80s and the 90s managed to return nearly 40% annually and their investors gladly paid them 2% of their assets and 20% of their profits as fees. Investors' net returns averaged above 30% annually and hedge funds managers gradually turned into billionaires.

Investors gradually shifted their assets into hedge funds. Hedge funds' assets under management first crossed the $1 billion mark, then the $100 billion and the trillion mark in this millennium. The demand for hedge funds created its own supply. The assets of well-known hedge funds run into tens of billions and most of them closed their doors to new investors. As a result investors handed their assets to the offshoots of these well-known hedge funds and other fund managers who were good at marketing but not very good at picking stocks.

Today, an average hedge fund can't generate more outperformance than the rich fees it charges. They found a neat solution that works for them but not for their investors. Initially hedge funds were called hedge funds because they were hedging their net exposure. Over the last 20 years, the net exposure of hedge funds started to creep up to 30%, 40%, 50%, and 80% level. This new approach enabled them to generate single digit returns during bull markets and enrich themselves. Nowadays, there are only a few hedge funds that have near zero net market exposure.

One of these hedge funds is John Brandmeyer and Jonathan C. Angrist's Cognios Capital. The Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund takes positions in undervalued U.S. stocks and balance this long exposure by shorting overvalued U.S. stocks across different industries. Cognios Capital isn't as greedy as other hedge funds and this market neutral strategy only charges 1.5% annually (no incentive fees). This means its investors will generate positive returns if Cognios' long positions beat its short positions by more than 1.5 percentage points.

Cognios was successful in delivering positive returns since its inception. The Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund returned 3% annually after fees. The fund returned 5.6% in 2015, -0.8% in 2016, 5% in 2017, 3.9% in 2018, -0.6% in 2019, and -2.1% during the first quarter of 2020. According to Cognios Capital's latest 13F filing, the fund's top 5 positions at the end of March were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

These are actually great large-cap stock picks. Four of these stocks are also among the top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of only 6.9% during the first quarter. If you had invested only in the top 5 hedge fund stocks and shorted the S&P 500 Index, you would have returned nearly 13% with zero net market exposure. Hedge funds' consensus picks is a fertile area to find undervalued stocks.

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years. So, we are also good at picking winners like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

But Wall Street analysts already are thinking post-coronavirus when it comes to Apple stock.

X

Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives on Tuesday raised his 12-month price target on Apple stock to 350 from 335. He also reiterated his outperform rating.

On the stock market today, Apple stock fell 1.1% to 311.41. Earlier in the session, it had been up as much as 1.5% before retreating.

Ives described the company's upcoming iPhone 12 series as ""the light at the end of the tunnel for Apple."" when it comes to the tech giant's post-coronavirus life. Those handsets will include Apple's first 5G iPhones. They are due out in September at the earliest but should be ready before the holiday shopping season.

Pent-Up Demand For 5G iPhones

""The investment thesis on Apple for fiscal 2021 and beyond has remained on course although some darker days are still ahead with the global lockdown and dismal economic backdrop,"" Ives said in a note to clients. Apple's fiscal 2021 starts on Sept. 27.

""With (Apple) stores opening up to strong demand throughout Asia and a handful of U.S. stores opening up this week, coupled by a recovering supply chain which is on the path to normalization, it appears Apple is starting to lay the early groundwork for the next chapter of growth,"" Ives said.

With an aging installed base of iPhones, there is a pent-up demand for next-generation iPhones, Ives said. He estimates that about 350 million of the 925 million iPhones in use worldwide are due for an upgrade.

Elsewhere on Wall Street, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 325.

""Though initial view that spend on Apple products is more discretionary and could be impacted in a downturn is somewhat valid, we believe there is pent-up demand as purchase intent has improved and consumers have more discretionary spend available (fewer vacations, dining out, etc.),"" Arcuri said in a note to clients.

Apple Stock On IBD Stock Watchlists

Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a best-possible 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup tool. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Apple stock is on IBD's prestigious Leaderboard watchlist. It also is on IBD's SwingTrader list of actionable stocks.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-says-delivery-speed-returning-014814866.html,FB,2020-05-13T01:48:14+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says the one- and two-day delivery times that shoppers have come to expect should gradually return in coming weeks as the online retailer catches up from a demand surge tied to the coronavirus outbreak.

The company on Sunday lifted restrictions on the amount of inventory its suppliers can send to Amazon warehouses and is shortening delivery times -- which had stretched for weeks for some products since the outbreak began -- back to days.

Amazon spends months preparing for the surge in consumer demand that usually comes during the holiday season. The Covid-19 outbreak that closed many retail brick-and-mortar stores and sent millions of shoppers online created a month’s worth of Black Friday spending without warning. Once Amazon fell behind, it took several weeks and hiring 175,000 people to get back on track.

“We removed quantity limits on products our suppliers can send to our fulfillment centers,” Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said in an email. “We continue to adhere to extensive health and safety measures to protect our associates as they pick, pack and ship products to customers, and are improving delivery speeds across our store.”

Even with the delays, Amazon saw a major spike in sales tied to the coronavirus outbreak because shoppers had so few choices. Amazon, big box stores, supermarkets and pharmacies were among the few businesses deemed essential and allowed to remain open. But the delays were starting to tarnish Amazon’s reputation with its customers and its merchants who supply more than half the goods sold on the site.

Quick delivery is central to Amazon’s customer promise, helping it attract more than 100 million people who pay monthly or yearly dues for Prime memberships. Prime members spend more on the site than non-Prime members, making it critical for Amazon to get its delivery times back to normal especially as retail stores begin reopening and shoppers have more options.

When Seattle-based Amazon was overwhelmed in April, many shoppers saw the long delivery times and shifted their purchases to pickup curbside options offered by Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., said Anthony Ferry, chief executive officer of PriceSpider, which tracks web traffic for more than 1,600 brands, including consumer staples made by Procter & Gamble Co. and Kraft Heinz Co.

“Loyal Amazon shoppers left the site when they saw long delivery times or items were out of stock,” he said. “Buy-online pickup-in store has become a much more enticing and desirable solution when people want something now.”

Amazon let employees worried about their safety take time off during the outbreak, which increased absenteeism and aggravated the delays. Some lawmakers, unions and workers have criticized Amazon for not doing enough to protect its warehouse workers and continuing deliveries through the pandemic. Company officials have said repeatedly they have taken multiple steps, including extensive cleaning at facilities, to keep its employees healthy.

Long delivery times were beginning to erode Amazon’s stellar brand reputation among consumers, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the New York research firm Marketplace Pulse that monitors the site. Shoppers left 800,000 negative reviews on Amazon’s shopping site in April, double the number in the same month a year ago, with much of the increase attributable to longer delivery times, he said.

“Amazon is known for great selection, low prices and fast shipping,” Kaziukenas said. “These all broke during the pandemic. Selection was not always there, prices were not lowest because Amazon sold out, and fast shipping was gone.”

Even Amazon’s merchants, many of whom rely on the company to store, pack and ship their products through the Fulfillment By Amazon logistics service, started doing things themselves to quicken the pace of deliveries.

Bellroy has been selling wallets, smartphone cases and laptop sleeves on Amazon for seven years and used Fulfillment By Amazon because quick delivery is popular with coveted Prime members. But by the end of March, delivery times for many of its products were as long as 30 days and sales plummeted. Amazon was prioritizing essential items. So Bellroy began packing and shipping many of its products itself, and now does the logistics for about 20% of its sales on Amazon, said Lina Calabria, co-founder and chief operating officer of the company.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hong-kong-tests-traveler-saliva-231637145.html,FB,2020-05-06T11:07:27+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Layla Keith had just gotten off a flight from Singapore when she and her fellow passengers were met at the gate by Hong Kong government officials and ushered onto buses that shuttled them to a nearby convention center.

There, they were handed forms to fill out and given small containers to spit into.

“They just put all the samples in a tray and told us to go,” said Keith, a junior at an international high school in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. “I mean, we just didn’t really have a choice.”

Those who tested positive for the coronavirus were sent to a hospital for treatment; others were allowed to go. But the data from their saliva stayed behind in a government database.

In the global battle to curb Covid-19, governments have collected troves of data from testing and contact-tracing apps to try to find the disease and stop its spread. Even as many are willing to surrender personal information amid the crisis, privacy experts worry about who controls the data and what will happen to it after the crisis ends.

Hong Kong began imposing stricter measures on travelers after a rebound in coronavirus cases was brought on by residents returning from more severely stricken areas. Non-residents were banned from entry, and a mandatory quarantine was required for those returning home.

In addition, on April 8, incoming travelers were required to submit “deep throat saliva” tests, after being shuttled to a nearby center. Starting April 22, asymptomatic passengers had to wait for their test results before being allowed to leave.

Even as contact tracing apps have raised concerns about state surveillance, the involuntary surrender of DNA or other biodata takes it a step further, providing governments with sensitive and unchangeable fragments of personal identity. Saliva samples are used by DNA testing companies, for instance, to glean insights on ancestry, certain traits and predisposition to certain health ailments.

In Hong Kong, where pro-Democracy protests continue, some worry that the pandemic may give government officials the opportunity to make restrictions on privacy permanent. How Hong Kong uses the biodata it collects from travelers could provide some detail on whether or how that might happen.

“The problem of collection of biodata in the age of artificial intelligence and big data is a concern globally, especially in the administration of cross-border travel, where governments around the world are increasingly collecting and storing travelers’ data, from fingerprints to facial recognition to saliva,” said Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.

“Travelers, and in particular foreigners, don’t have rights to challenge this collection or this use or storage, and have very little ability to seek redress,” she said.

Biodata can be particularly revealing and therefore valuable to hackers or repressive governments. It could expose medical histories or contribute to selective surveillance of political activists. It could also compromise a person’s ability to get insurance or open a bank account, experts warn. In China, authorities are already using DNA data to keep track of the Uighur population.

Hong Kong’s health ministry told Bloomberg News it would dispose of the saliva samples according to laboratory protocols, but it didn’t say what those were. In forms travelers fill out on arrival at the airport, they are told the government “will take all practicable steps to ensure that personal data is not kept longer than necessary.”

The ministry also said the data would be accessible to government departments where deemed necessary. However it wasn’t clear whether this referred to the passengers’ travel and personal history, or the data yielded from the saliva samples. The ministry didn’t respond to repeated requests for clarification.

Authorities should be using saliva to determine if someone is infected with Covid-19 and then disposing of the sample, said David Murdoch, dean of the University of Otago in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a specialist in infectious diseases. Governments shouldn’t try to pull additional information from such a sample without a person’s consent, he said.

Some governments, like Singapore’s, have vowed to delete any private data or anonymize as much as they can.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockdowns-lift-infection-surge-still-110232024.html,FB,2020-05-09T11:02:32+00:00,"(Bloomberg) --

Political leaders across the globe are surveying the smoking wrecks of their economies and trying to find a way to lift their virus lockdowns, allow citizens to leave their homes and get businesses up and running again. But when is the right time and under what conditions?

With the constant threat of a second wave of infections and growing tensions between the U.S. and China over who is to blame for the global pandemic there are no easy answers, particularly as the jobless rate continues to rise. But there are lessons from past epidemics — like Ebola — to help shield vulnerable African countries, as well as business opportunities for those willing to lure companies away from Beijing while its trade war with Washington drags on.

Dig deeper into these and other topics with the latest edition of Weekend Reads.

Trump Goes All In on Vaccine and May Still Get Beaten by ChinaWhen the Soviet Union put the first man into space in 1961, the shock to America’s self-confidence was electric. If China should be first to produce a successful vaccine against the coronavirus, U.S. prestige is likely to suffer a similar blow, Marc Champion reports.

Lawsuits Against China Escalate Covid-19 Blame Game With U.S.Trump has joined a chorus of calls for China to pay damages from the Covid-19 pandemic, as Sheridan Prasso explains. His remarks follow several bills proposed by Republican members of Congress seeking to strip China of its sovereign immunity protection in U.S. courts, potentially leaving Beijing open to billion dollar lawsuits.

Cold, Crowded, Deadly: Virus Stalks Workers at U.S. Meat PlantsMarch was a time of spreading disease and denial across the U.S. meat and poultry industry. Laborers in the immense slaughterhouses passed the contagion on processing lines and in locker rooms, then in their homes. As Peter Waldman, Lydia Mulvany and Polly Mosendz report, the toll on workers and the nation’s food supply is only now becoming clear.

Layoffs Start Turning From Temporary to Permanent Across AmericaWith a history going back to 1881, the Michigan Maple Block Co. has long been a fixture in the small northern town of Petoskey. Yet it will soon close and lay off all 56 workers. It points to a worrying trend, Shawn Donnan and Joe Deaux report, with furloughs that just a month ago were labeled “temporary” now tagged “indefinite” or “permanent.”

The Man Who Put Lula in Jail May Become Bolsonaro’s NemesisThe legal star who brought down a ring of corrupt politicians and business leaders in Brazil is back in the hunt. Sergio Moro’s challenge now is to prove his allegations against Jair Bolsonaro — even if it means the possible impeachment of another Brazilian president, as Simone Iglesias and Samy Adghirni explain.

She’s 35 and Finance Minister and Suddenly a Rock Star in PeruEveryone calls her Toni. Mothers take selfies of her with their children, and street hawkers push bracelets into her hand as presents. Artists sketch her portrait and post them to social media. TV networks vie for interviews and run profiles asking, “Who is Maria Antonieta Alva? John Quigley profiles Peru’s finance minister.

Why the U.K. Virus App Could Be Another Pandemic MisstepThe U.K. took its own route into a coronavirus lockdown, and now appears to be pursuing its own route out as well. As Suzi Ring and Robert Hutton explain, the government has developed a contact-tracing mobile-phone app that works differently from those favored by many other countries whose technology is supported by Google and Apple.

India Looks to Lure More Than 1,000 U.S. Companies Out of ChinaTrump’s move to blame China for its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to worsen global trade ties as companies and governments move resources out of the world’s second-largest economy to diversify supply chains. India is looking to capitalize on that, as Archana Chaudhary reports.

China Risks Further Isolation in Backing Africa’s Coal ProjectsFor more than two decades, Zimbabwe has been trying to break ground on a giant coal-power complex. China just agreed to get the $4.2 billion project underway, but as Antony Sguazzin, Godfrey Marawanyika and Jing Li write, Beijing’s involvement in coal is isolating it further from the rest of the world.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-waste-world-great-120032218.html,FB,2020-05-09T12:00:32+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the coronavirus pandemic continues, Bloomberg Opinion will be running a series of features by our columnists that consider the long-term consequences of the crisis. This column is part of a package on transformations in the way in which education is structured and delivered. For more, see Michael Petrilli on how older students can benefit from reduced school schedules. When we were told over the Lunar New Year holiday that schools in Hong Kong would be closed to prevent the spread of a then still-distant illness, I went through all the stages of grief. Shock, denial, anger, bargaining. I settled on depression for a good while. With three primary-age children, my vision of juggling a new job, school, chores and a bad-tempered dog was one of Brueghelian pandemonium. I had little faith in the quality of education my kids would receive online.

Four months in, my skepticism has in large part faded. What’s allowed me to accept, and then embrace, the educational havoc wrought by the virus has been its unexpected impact on my middle son, a 9-year-old on the autism spectrum. With a more flexible approach, he’s been able to cover the curriculum with a combination of live and recorded assignments provided by school, and find space for niche interests in a more creative, student-led set-up. We’ve recruited outside support that has helped to reinforce corners of math which eluded him first time around. Our new, fuzzier world allowed him to catch up, and thrive.

My son’s experience with remote learning is in many ways exceptional — but it may also provide clues to how school systems around the world can harness the potential of technology to improve outcomes for all students. The quality of education students have received during this crisis has been uneven. The digital divide, and the related homework gap, are painfully real. Wealthier parents can afford to stay home; they are more educated and better able to support their children; they have enough laptops, steady Wi-Fi and live in homes where there’s a modicum of personal space. In Hong Kong, nearly 97% of less-well-off children in a March survey by the The Society for Community Organization reported problems with distance learning, much of it related to poor internet connections. Even those who overcome that obstacle cannot always unlock online opportunities without extra help.

That doesn’t mean that the greatest learning experiment in history is doomed to fail. There’s a very real possibility we will see more disruptions, whether driven by extreme weather or pandemics, and we can’t afford to have hundreds of millions of children falling behind. With the right infrastructure, it’s possible to rethink academic structures that have in many ways been unchanged since the Victorian period, and come out with options that are more inclusive and flexible. It won’t be cheap, but in the age of multi-trillion fiscal stimulus, it may be the best investment we make.

Almost everyone I’ve spoken to, from head teachers to students and parents, has expressed frustration over the abrupt switch to virtual schooling during the current health crisis. Most institutions were ill-prepared to move to online instruction. In part, this comes from our overoptimistic views of how easy it is to teach and learn online. That’s not new: Radio, then television, and later mass open online courses, were also supposed to provide high-quality free education for all, yet haven’t quite lived up to expectations.

Distance learning comes with inherent limitations. In China, online tuition is a 500 billion yuan, or nearly $71 billion industry, but even at that size, virtual lessons don’t make the bricks-and-mortar alternative irrelevant. Schools help children turn into self-sufficient beings that can thrive in society. They teach and model good study habits. They also allow parents to work, and in many places, they mean shelter and nutritious food that is otherwise unavailable. Physical schools played these critical roles before the pandemic, and these functions will be even more essential after it passes.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-asked-states-produce-data-175638596.html,AMZN,2020-05-12T17:56:38+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is being asked by several U.S. states to provide information about health and safety measures following the death of a number of workers from coronavirus-related illnesses.

Led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, 13 states on Tuesday sent a letter to the company expressing concern about recent media reports of “inadequate safety measures and sick leave policies, insufficient data about infections and deaths among their workers, and retaliation against workers who call attention to unsafe workplace conditions.”

The states ask Amazon and its Whole Foods subsidiary to provide details of health and safety measures they have adopted, compliance with state paid sick leave laws and data about worker infections and deaths. The same states sent a letter to Amazon in March urging it to improve its sick leave policies.

While the company hasn’t disclosed how many workers have tested positive for Covid-19, news outlets have reported at least seven coronavirus deaths of Amazon employees, including workers in its warehouses and at Whole Foods stores.

“Amazon and Whole Foods must take every possible step to protect their employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Healey said in a statement. “We again call on these companies to provide assurances that they are complying with state laws and federal guidance aimed at keeping essential workers safe during this crisis.”

Amazon is hiring 175,000 workers to keep up with booming demand from shoppers forced online by stay-at-home orders. At the same time, employees have staged demonstrations over allegedly unsafe working conditions at the company’s facilities. The company has said it is checking employee temperatures at the beginning of shifts, cleaning facilities, increasing space between workers and taking other safety measures.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos last month said the company would spend $4 billion on logistics during the outbreak, including to keep workers safe.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-atlantic-said-talks-reliance-200325151.html,FB,2020-05-08T20:03:25+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- General Atlantic is in talks to invest in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jio Platforms, according to people with knowledge of the matter, which would make it the latest in a series of high-profile backers of the $65 billion Indian telecommunications provider.

The private equity firm is considering investing about $850 million to $950 million in the Mumbai-based company, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The deal could be completed as soon as this month, though no agreement has been finalized and plans may change, the people said.

A transaction would add to the $8 billion of investments that Jio has sealed in the past month. Facebook Inc. in April agreed to pay $5.7 billion for a 10% stake in the digital unit, while Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners said they would invest about $2.25 billion in total in two separate transactions this week.

The string of investments from technology giants and private equity firms will go toward slashing debt at Reliance Industries, which is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, who is Asia’s richest man. The outside money also helps set a valuation for Jio, which until recently has been largely owned by the billionaire’s conglomerate.

Investors are betting on Jio’s access to India’s huge consumer market, and its potential to shake up traditional industries in the country -- from retail to education and payments -- with its technology.

A representative for Reliance Industries didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, while General Atlantic declined to comment.

Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund is also considering purchasing a minority stake in Jio, Bloomberg News reported earlier Friday.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-removes-2-5-million-160356295.html,FB,2020-05-12T20:03:56+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. said it has removed 2.5 million posts since March 1 offering masks, sanitizers, cleaning wipes and Covid-19 test kits, in an attempt to prevent users from price-gouging or selling counterfeit and dangerous products.

To do it, the social media company relied on the same image-recognition technology it uses to remove sales of guns and drugs. Facebook has had to quickly train its artificial intelligence to handle an increase in coronavirus content that violates company policies, including hundreds of thousands of posts removed for displaying information that could lead to physical harm, like encouraging users to drink bleach as a cure.

The coronavirus statistics released Tuesday are the latest addendum to the company’s twice-yearly report about enforcement to combat the dark side of the way its platforms are used. With each report, Facebook becomes more reliant on computer solutions to human problems. The company has about 15,000 content moderators working around the world, some of whom can’t work from the office as a protection against the spread of the virus. Between October 2019 and March 2020, about 90% of the content Facebook removed was found first by the software, not user reports, the company said.

In the first quarter of 2020, Facebook said it took down 1.7 billion fake accounts, 39.5 million instances of adult nudity and 7.9 million posts touting illegal drugs.

Facebook said it has been slowly allowing content moderators to do their jobs from home, accounting for privacy and security restrictions, and attempting to monitor their mental health. Still, long term, the company is investing less in humans and more in AI. Facebook can now build classifiers for harmful content that understand the same concept in multiple languages -- which is useful because the company doesn’t have enough moderators proficient in every language its users speak.

“We do unfortunately expect to make more mistakes until we’re able to ramp everything up,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on a call with reporters discussing the enforcement statistics.

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Apple Inc <AAPL.O> said Friday it will reopen a handful of stores in four U.S. states starting next week, in the first resumption of physical retail operations since the iPhone maker shuttered all U.S. stores in mid-March.

The company said it will open ""some"" stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina. Apple has two stores in both South Carolina and Alabama but did not say which would open. Its Boise, Idaho location will open Monday, with others to follow later in the week.

Apple executives have said they are examining local health data at the county and city level in each community where the company has physical stores to determine when to reopen. Apple has locations in several U.S. states, such as Texas and Georgia, where state rules would in theory allow it to reopen stores, but it has not yet announced plans to do so.

""Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will,"" Apple said in a statement.

In the four states where Apple stores will reopen, new procedures will be in place similar to those in countries such as South Korea, Australia and Austria, where stores have already reopened.

Customers and employees will be required to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the stores, and Apple will provide a mask if customers do not have their own. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of customers in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.

""With many working and learning from home, our primary focus will be providing service and support,"" Apple said. ""We recommend, where possible, customers buy online for contactless delivery or in-store pick-up.""

Apple will still have demonstration devices for customers to handle in the store, but staff will clean them often, and hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed in stores.

Apple earlier on Friday said it would reopen stores in Germany. The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores began reopening outside the Greater China region in mid-April with its store in South Korea.

Earnings Calendar Highlights

MONDAY

Earnings Spotlight: Marriott International (MAR, $85.98) - Monday's earnings slate is going to feature a few well-telegraphed train wrecks. That includes hotelier Marriott International, which is expected to report a 14.8% decline in first-quarter revenues, as well as a 35.5% drop in profits, when it reports ahead of the May 11 open. Marriott has already furloughed tens of thousands of front-line workers as well as thousands of corporate employees, and it has been building liquidity, including picking up a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility in April. The goal for now is the same as others in the hotel industry: survive until the pandemic wanes and business begins to return to normal. For now, most analysts are on the sidelines, with 13 Holds versus just 2 Buys and 1 Sell over the past three months. Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiole is more optimistic about the long-term, however, writing that ""We expect Marriott to expand room and revenue share in the hotel industry over the next decade, driven by a favorable next-generation traveler position supported by renovated and newer brands, as well as its industry-leading loyalty program.""

Earnings Spotlight: Simon Property Group (SPG, $58.02) - Simon Property is the largest shopping mall operator in the U.S., as well as the largest mall-focused real estate investment trust (REIT). It owns or holds interest in 204 properties in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as another 29 internationally. And, as one would imagine, Wall Street isn't too keen on its business prospects right now. Shares are off more than 60% year-to-date, and that's after the company's late-April announcement of plans to reopen 49 of its location with stepped-up sanitation and safety measures. Simon also has to contend with COVID-19's effects on Taubman Centers, a smaller mall REIT that SPG bought earlier this year. Bank of America's Craig Schmidt (Neutral, equivalent of Hold) writes that Simon faces ""unprecedented challenges"" and that coronavirus-triggered closures could be ""the final nail in the coffin"" for some of its retail tenants. That said, Simon's difficulties won't necessarily be reflected in its upcoming report, due out after Monday's close. The company is expected to report a 0.4% year-over-year improvement in revenues to $1.29 billion, and an 8.4% decline in profits to $1.63 per share.

Noteworthy Earnings Reports: Casper Sleep (CSPR), Duke Energy (DUK), Gladstone Investment (GAIN), Honda Motor (HMC), Ingersoll Rand (IR), Logitech (LOGI), Macerich (MAC), Toyota Motor (TM)

WEDNESDAY

Earnings Spotlight: Cisco Systems (CSCO, $42.99) - Networking and telecommunications giant Cisco Systems is more or less tracking the market with a 10% loss year-to-date, and investors will get an update on its most recent earnings after the May 13 closing bell. While the coronavirus' biggest effects so far have been on consumer-facing businesses as well as the oil industry, CSCO might be feeling the pinch from a pullback in business spending. Cleveland Research analyst Ben Bollin (Neutral) wrote in mid-April that channel checks suggested demand had dropped off in April, with some customers pushing back or canceling plans. The pros expect a soft quarter from Cisco, estimating an 8.6% decline in revenues to $11.88 billion, and a 9% dip in profits to 71 cents per share."
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053115/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,FB,2020-05-07T11:23:22.103000+00:00,"Video games have been around for decades, providing entertainment for children and adults alike. They have evolved significantly from the early days of computer games and the first versions of Nintendo and Atari. The days of pixelated screens and limited sounds are a distant memory as video games have become more lifelike than ever. As technology continues to improve, so do video games.

Video game creation has become increasingly complex, and the cost of creating a game to run on one of the major consoles has risen with this greater complexity. It was once unthinkable to sink millions into development costs, but games today can cost tens and even hundreds of millions. This has pushed game development into Hollywood movie territory in terms of production and marketing costs.

The video game sector is immensely large. In fact, it is larger than the movie and music industry combined, and it is only growing. Though it doesn't get the same attention that the movie and music industry does, there are over two billion gamers across the world. That is 26% of the world's population.

It's no surprise that companies want a piece of the pie. Analysts predict that by 2022, the gaming industry will generate $196 billion in revenue. As such, tech companies are looking to get involved in this revenue stream. Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), have all made plays to enter the video game industry.

Streaming and the Involvement of Tech Companies

Nontraditional gaming companies, like Facebook, Apple, and Google, are getting into the industry. The tech industry is looking for ways to make video game streaming as natural as streaming a song on Spotify or a movie on Netflix.

Microsoft (MSFT), which has already been in the gaming industry through its popular Xbox console, launched Project xCloud, which is a video game streaming service that allows users to stream Microsoft's Xbox games to PCs or other devices. The project launched for use in early 2020.

In 2016, Facebook began developing a gaming platform with Unity Technologies, which makes a game development framework for people to make video games. Google launched its program, Stadia, which is Google's cloud gaming service, that allows users to play streaming video games with extremely high quality. It is available through Google's browser, phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

The key goal for all of these companies is to allow players to stream video games without the need of a computer or a video game console, as the world moves more and more to life being centered around the mobile phone. As this trend continues, purchasing physical video games, in the form of cartridges or discs, is starting to go out the window.

Subscription streaming services are the future and will be beneficial to video game companies, like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts, as manufacturing, shipping, and storage costs will all disappear. Subscription services have also allowed for revenue generation to occur throughout the year, whereas traditionally, games were bought during holidays and other big occasion events.

Technical Innovations

Virtual reality is here. Oculus VR, a subsidiary of Facebook, is working hard on improving the quality of the virtual reality headsets it has already released. Oculus VR was purchased by Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion. The Oculus Quest line is Facebook's mid-range offering of the product, which is sold for $399. Facebook expects updated models to be announced for release in 2020.

Video games have already surpassed many other forms of entertainment as far as immersion goes, and virtual reality will add yet another layer. There will also be further experimentation with controls, such as adding voice, touch screens, and gestures to game mechanics when the consoles add peripherals to take in those inputs.

Apple is also targeting the release of a virtual reality headset in 2021 or 2022.

Merchandising

Like Hollywood, the video game industry needs to spin more revenue off of its intellectual property because the product costs a lot to make. Merchandising is already around, with t-shirts, figures, hats, mugs, and more. The Halo series on Microsoft’s Xbox has spread to other forms of content through novels and comic books in addition to an upcoming television series and a long-rumored movie. This may become the approach for all successful video game series to follow.

In fact, the popular video game, Assassin's Creed, a game developed by Ubisoft, was made into a movie in 2016 with prominent actors. Sega's popular Sonic the Hedgehog game was made into a successful movie in 2020, starring well-known actors, and set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game based movie.

Market Demographics Are Expanding

Another trend in the video game industry is the expansion of the market as far as demographics go. People are playing games both earlier and later in life, and the gender mix is nearing par. The top-level gamers competing in the eSports leagues have gained enough recognition that they can apply for the professional athlete visa when entering the U.S. Gaming has a wide appeal, and it is still growing.

Video games have become so popular on a mass scale that certain players stream videos of themselves playing video games at home and make hundreds and thousands of dollars by doing so. This has become another revenue generation sector of the video game market.

Vintage Video Games

As the world becomes nostalgic and we see reboots and remakes of loved films and shows from decades ago, the same is happening for video games. Vintage video games from the early days of the industry are in high demand and have become extremely popular, not only with older players who experienced the games first hand but also with a new generation of players.

Many companies have taken advantage of this nostalgia and released updated versions of their consoles. Nintendo (NTDOF), more than any other company, has successfully taken advantage of this interest in retro video games, by releasing Nintendo Classic Mini and Nintendo Switch, two consoles that allow for playing classic Nintendo video games. This has become a solid revenue stream for companies that were around at the early stages of the industry.

The Bottom Line

The video game industry has always been about innovation. New technology, new controls, and new experiences are to be expected. As the world moves more and more to time spent on their mobile phones, streaming services and mobile phone game playing will become an important arena for revenues, and large tech companies will look to leverage their current framework to get involved."

Expectations had been that Facebook would have the replacement to the existing Quest headset ready for the holiday selling season, but with supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic, that could be pushed out to 2021, reports Bloomberg News.

Sources told Bloomberg the tech stock is developing several models that weigh less, have a reduced size, and a better refresh rate that makes the experience more realistic. The unit hasn't made a final decision on which one will be brought to the market. The headsets in development are equipped with four cameras and support the ability for users to look all around. Facebook is reportedly fixing flaws with the controllers in the current model.

The Quest headset, which doesn't require a customer to hook up to a computer or mobile device, sells for $299. The device has been in demand during the pandemic as millions of people shelter at home.

During Facebook's first-quarter earnings conference call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said demand for Quest has ""surpassed our expectations,"" and the company wished they could make more of them at a faster rate during the pandemic. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the demand may not continue once the virus is contained, but for now, he's happy with the product's performance.

Back in 2014, Facebook made a $2 billion bet on Oculus, predicting the VR market would take off in a big way. That vision has failed to materialize so far, although the pandemic is helping with demand."

The stock is building the right side of a 15-week cup base with a 224.30 buy point, MarketSmith chart analysis shows. It's now about 6% away from the entry. But a potential handle could present a lower buy point. The base's 39% correction, top to bottom, is a bit steeper than ideal — but is well within the norm for a bear market.

The relative strength line, which compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, is already at new highs. That's a bullish sign.

IBD Stock Checkup assigns Facebook a 98 Composite Rating, which gives investors a simple way to gauge a stock's key fundamental and technical metrics. That puts Facebook at the top of the 64-stock internet content group.

A 99 Earnings Per Share Rating, part of the overall composite score, is also among the best stocks in the group. That reflects a five-year compound earnings growth rate of 55%. Analysts expect earnings to rise 15% this year and 31% the next.

The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company is benefiting from worldwide lockdowns due to the coronavirus outbreak, as people shelter at home. And Facebook has stayed nimble. It countered Zoom Video (ZM), which enables users to hold meetings, with Messenger Rooms. Messenger Rooms lets up to 50 people chat or hang out online.

Stocks To Watch: Facebook Beats

Last week, the social media giant reported adjusted profit that doubled to $1.71 a share on 18% higher revenue of $17.7 billion. Results topped views for $1.74 on $17.4 billion in revenue. Daily active users jumped 11% to 1.73 billion from Q1 last year.

""After a strong start to the quarter, we saw a significant impact on our business as a consequence of the pandemic from the second week of March onward,"" Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on the earnings conference call. ""This impact has not been felt evenly.""

She cited strong growth in gaming and relative stability in e-commerce and technology, but ""significant declines"" in travel and auto. The latter two are getting slammed by the coronavirus, which has brought travel-related industries virtually to a halt.

Like many other companies, Facebook pulled guidance for Q2 and the full year. Digital advertising has taken a hit as Covid-19 takes its toll on businesses worldwide. Facebook gets about 98% of its revenue from advertisers.

Withdraws Outlook, For Now

""Given the increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full year 2020. Rather, I would like to provide a snapshot of revenue performance in the second quarter thus far,"" Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on the call. ""After initial steep decrease in ad revenue in March, we have seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April.""

Most analysts remain bullish on the social network. Following Facebook's earnings, more than a dozen analysts reiterated their buy ratings, according to TipRanks.

""Our conversations with industry contacts suggest digital media spending remains under significant pressure,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a recent report to clients. He added that, ""while the second quarter likely marks a bottom, ad budgets are unlikely to recover meaningfully until closer to the seasonally important fourth quarter.""

With that in mind, we rounded up five Motley Fool contributors who regularly cover the oil industry and asked them what sectors they think have superior prospects. They came back with five different sectors, and shared a top stock pick from each one.

Here are the investments they believe are better bets than oil right now.

Bet on big tech instead

Travis Hoium (big technology): You may not realize it, but we're using big tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) now more than ever, and I think that's going to grow in the future. Not only are we using products and services they provide directly, such as search, email, and word processing, but these are also two of the companies building the infrastructure that new technologies are built on.

Cloud services have become services that customers use directly with products such as Gmail or the Office 365 suite of products. But when you search for a product online or play a game or stream a movie, it's big tech companies that are behind those services. And that's driving growth in cloud products, with intelligent cloud segment revenue up 27% at Microsoft in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 to $12.3 billion and Google Cloud revenue up 52.2% to $2.8 billion.

I'm highlighting the cloud here, but there's a lot more that big tech companies such as Alphabet and Microsoft offer, and their scale gives a huge competitive advantage. Unlike two decades ago, new tech giants aren't sprouting up regularly, and the companies that do pop up are usually built on the back of existing giants. That's why I'm betting on big tech's future rather than oil.

Slowly but surely, renewable energy is displacing oil

Matt DiLallo (renewable energy): Interest in oil stocks seems to rise as its price declines because it encourages more traders to speculate that they'll recover. However, instead of gambling on a short-term rebound in the oil sector, a better play is to invest is in the long-term growth of renewable energy, which will displace oil in the coming decades.

One excellent renewable-focused investment option is electric utility NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), which also happens to be the world's largest producer of energy from the wind and sun. The company's business model -- which includes a heavy focus on locking in rates for the renewable power it produces via long-term contracts -- largely insulates it from volatility, something that plagues the oil sector.

That gives NextEra high confidence that it can grow its earnings by 6% to 8% per year through 2022, which should enable it to boost its dividend by at least 10% annually during that timeframe. Contrast that with most oil stocks, which have seen their earnings and dividends plummet along with oil prices this year. Many will never recover their former heights while NextEra's could keep expanding for decades, powered by its renewable-focused expansion program.

Housing has a huge tailwind

Jason Hall (housing): According to the U.S. Census Bureau, new construction of single-family homes fell 18% in March. It's a near certainty that home construction will have fallen more in April and probably decline deep into 2020.

So why in the world would anyone want to buy a homebuilder? These tend to be highly leveraged companies with large amounts of undeveloped land on its books. That's a recipe for disaster in the middle of a major economic crisis: owning an asset nobody wants to buy but needing to sell it to pay off lenders. The answer, in short, is because homebuilder NVR (NYSE:NVR) will get through the crisis in fine shape and then profit from the massive demographic trend that's driving home sales.

NVR is a rare breed. It uses less leverage than most of its peers by far, buying land with options contracts that let it walk away -- at the cost of some money -- versus ending up buried in debt for land it can't develop because of the collapse in housing.

That's a powerful competitive advantage in the highly cyclical housing industry. It also has over $1 billion in cash on the books, so it's set to ride out the downturn better than other homebuilders.

What happens next is what makes NVR so compelling. Housing demand is on the rise and growing, as younger generations that had to put off homeownership in the aftermath of the Great Recession finally take the plunge. Once we get past the COVID-19 crisis, NVR should prove a market-beating investment over the next decade.

Irreplaceable assets and customers that have few options

Tyler Crowe (cell phone towers): Real estate always has been and will probably remain a less volatile asset than stocks, in general. One portion of the real estate market that's one of the more stable is cell phone towers. This unique asset class benefits from two things that make it an incredibly stable investment:

Its customers are big telecommunication companies, which need to rent space on tower to maintain their networks. Renting space on a cell tower isn't a discretionary expense. More advanced telecommunication networks require more equipment deployed to handle the additional network traffic but have to do so on a limited amount of space on fixed cell towers.

These two elements have made cell phone towers an incredibly stable and lucrative asset for their owners, and it has made American Tower (NYSE:AMT) an incredibly compelling real estate investment trust to own. The company owns and operates 180,000 towers in 19 countries. The combination of international acquisitions growing tower count and increased network equipment demands for 5G increasing per-tower revenue have given this REIT an incredible growth runway.

Under normal operating conditions, American Tower has been growing quickly and providing a reliable dividend to its shareholders. With the market assigning a slight discount to all-time highs, this is a stock to buy and hold for decades.

The cutting edge

John Bromels (healthcare technology): The global healthcare system is reeling right now from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, but it's still on its feet thanks to the efforts of doctors, nurses, emergency personnel, and other healthcare professionals who are working through the crisis. COVID-19 is proving how essential healthcare is, and why investments in developing game-changing healthcare technology are critical.

One company at the forefront of medical technology is robot-assisted surgical devicemaker Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive manufactures the Da Vinci system, which -- you guessed it -- uses robotic tools to assist live surgeons in performing procedures, mostly in the fields of urology and gynecology. The system helps surgeons be less invasive and more precise, which leads to better patient outcomes. Better yet, Intuitive plans to expand the range of its offerings to include many other types of soft tissue surgery in the coming years.

Because many hospitals have understandably suspended elective surgical procedures, and installations of new systems have also been delayed, Intuitive's shares have taken a hit. However, that makes this an excellent opportunity to invest in the future of healthcare."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-surges-56-report-133822697.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T15:29:43+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. jumped as much as 56% on a media report that Amazon.com Inc. has discussed a potential takeover of the largest U.S. movie-theater owner, though it pared the gains when another outlet said the companies aren’t talking.

It’s unclear if the talks are active or will lead to a deal, the U.K.’s Mail on Sunday newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. Amazon doesn’t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday. AMC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The trade publication Deadline reported Monday morning that “there are no talks,” citing unidentified sources.

AMC shares rose as much as $2.31 to $6.41 in New York trading. They were up as little as 19% minutes after the Deadline report and were up 36% to $5.58 at 11:28 a.m. The stock was down 43% this year through last week, battered along with the rest of the cinema industry by a worldwide shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.

AMC’s bonds surged on reports of the talks with Amazon, and were among the top gainers in the U.S. high-yield market on Monday, according to Trace bond-trading data. AMC’s senior subordinated bonds due 2026 were up as much as 10 cents on the dollar to 32 cents, data shows.

The reported talks are unlikely to spark a price war for AMC, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst Amine Bensaid said in a note. “Movie-going is unlikely to fully bounce back in a post-Covid-19 world and may create risks for an acquirer,” he said. “AMC’s elevated debt load and unavoidable fixed costs mean the company’s near-term financial flexibility will be severely challenged.”

AMC showed its concern about existential threats with its reaction to last month’s straight-to-streaming release of the kids movie “Trolls World Tour,” which Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures crowed about as a high-grossing success. AMC said it would no longer show Universal’s movies.

Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, who spent billions of dollars building one of the world’s biggest cinema operators, controls AMC through his closely held Wanda Group. Wanda acquired AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion as part of its expansion into entertainment. It subsequently acquired Nordic, Carmike and Odeon & UCI Cinemas.

Along with its vast retail and web-services operations, Amazon is an active player in streaming with its Prime Video platform, along with releasing original films. Like Netflix Inc., Amazon is eager to shore up its burgeoning position in Hollywood as new and old players scrap for content deals. Buying a theater chain would guarantee another outlet for its movies.

Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley FBR, wrote to clients Monday that a cash offer for AMC, which is on track for its fourth straight year of stock declines, wouldn’t appeal to investors. A cash offer would be more likely than a stock deal, given AMC’s depressed stock price, he said.

Knee-deep in a proposed merger with technology licensing expert Xperi (NASDAQ:XPER), TiVo also chose to release a new product on Wednesday. The TiVo Stream 4K amounts to a strategy change because it proves that TiVo really doesn't want to become a leading vendor of technology solutions. It actually wants to be the next Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) instead.

The basics

Don't get me wrong -- TiVo has every intention of closing that merger with Xperi. TiVo's shareholders will vote on the merger in the company's annual shareholder meeting, which will be held online near the end of May. The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter.

The first-quarter report was also perfectly fine. Revenue rose 1% year over year, and TiVo's adjusted EBITDA profits increased by 55%. The company hunkered down behind a stable portfolio of multiyear licensing deals and cut down its operating expenses by 16%. That's hardly an exciting way to drive bottom-line growth, but it's a respectable way to make a living during the COVID-19 crisis.

Or is it?

Can this media stick change the game for TiVo?

The simultaneous mass-market release of the TiVo Stream 4K media-streaming dongle almost looks designed to turn the market's attention away from the earnings report -- or to take advantage of the larger media platform that comes with a quarterly report to boost the Stream 4K's marketing fortunes right out of the gate.

The device lets consumers watch and listen to thousands of media services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video (NASDAQ:AMZN). It comes with a 7-day trial to Dish Networks' Sling TV service, which offers a live-streaming platform for 50+ traditional TV stations. It's based on Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android technology with a built-in Chromecast feature as well as the Google Assistant voice-control tool.

The device's product page provides a handy table that compares Stream 4K to top-of-the-line devices from the Chromecast, Amazon Fire Stick, and Roku product families. As you'd expect from this promotional tactic, the device matches or beats all of them in every category, apart from the Chromecast Ultra having access to a much larger app library.

What is TiVo trying to do?

The TiVo Stream 4K wants to be all things to every media consumer. The key feature that sets this device apart from a Fire TV Stick or a high-end Chromecast is the ability to search for the content you want in a single search tool that can point you to any available media platform. Roku has a less refined version of the same idea, but this is exactly what TiVo has been cutting its teeth on for the last two decades.

""During the COVID-19 pandemic, viewers are struggling to find their favorite streaming shows. They are overwhelmed by an overflowing sea of streaming apps,"" TiVo CEO Dave Shull said in the first-quarter earnings call. ""TiVo Stream 4K integrates all of that content with the recommendation and search features to make it easier to find, watch, and enjoy the best entertainment, news, and sports from today's most popular services.""

If the company can deliver on its promise to simplify the media-streaming experience, Roku and the other hardware suppliers might have a real challenger on their hands. It's no slam-dunk win, of course, since this new device is different from the digital video recorders most of us associate with the TiVo brand, and the marketing push must be made while negotiating the complications of a game-changing merger.

But I'm curious to see what the TiVo Stream 4K can do and whether consumers are ready to adopt it before the coronavirus lock-in policies fade away. If TiVo wants to shift away from the stable but dull business of selling technology licenses under multiyear contracts, Roku's high-octane growth strategy certainly looks like an attractive role model."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/readies-coronavirus-app-checking-symptoms-195901425.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T19:59:01+00:00,"By Paresh Dave

OAKLAND, California May 8 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to launch an app this month to enable people in under-resourced countries to assess whether they may have the novel coronavirus, and is considering a Bluetooth-based contact tracing feature too, an official told Reuters on Friday.

The app will ask people about their symptoms and offer guidance on whether they may have COVID-19, the potentially lethal illness caused by the coronavirus, said Bernardo Mariano, chief information officer for the WHO. Other information, such as how to get tested, will be personalized according to the user's country.

Though the WHO will release a version on app stores globally, any government will be able to take the app's underlying technology, add features and release its own version on app stores, Mariano said in a phone interview.

India, Australia and the United Kingdom already have released official virus apps using their own technology, with common features including telling people whether to get tested based on their symptoms and logging people's movements to enable more efficient contact tracing.

Several countries are ramping up contact tracing, or the process of finding, testing and isolating individuals who crossed paths with an infectious individual. It is seen as vital to safely opening economies, and apps that automate parts of the process could accelerate efforts.

The WHO expects its app to draw interest in other countries, including some in South America and Africa where case numbers are rising. They may lack the technology and engineers to develop apps or be struggling to offer testing and education.

""The value is really for countries that do not have anything,"" Mariano said. ""We would be leaving behind the ones that are not able to (provide an app), that have fragile health systems.""

Engineers and designers, including some who previously worked at Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp , have been volunteering for weeks to develop the new app with about five of them overseeing the process. They are designing it open-source on the hosting service GitHub, meaning code is open to public input.

Several team members declined to comment.

Mariano said he wants to include additional tools beyond the symptom checker, including a self-help guide for mental health care.

The team also is considering what the WHO refers to as proximity tracing.

Engineers have done preliminary work and talked to smartphone operating system makers Apple Inc and Google about possibly adopting technology the companies plan to release jointly this month to make tracing easier.

The technology relies on virtual ""handshakes"" between phones that come within a few feet of each other for at least five minutes. Phones keep anonymized logs of such encounters, allowing someone who later tests positive to anonymously send notifications to recent contacts about their possible exposure to the virus.

But Mariano said legal and privacy considerations have prevented the WHO from committing to such a feature yet. He expressed concern about the many businesses pitching proximity tools turning around and using any personal data they gather to generate revenue later.

""We want to make sure we ring-fence all the risks around it,"" he said.

Apple and Google have said their system will not use any data for other purposes and will be stopped when the pandemic ends.

The WHO plans to release guidance as soon as next week on issues countries should consider as they weigh their own proximity tracing apps.

To reach people with limited internet access, the WHO is working to deliver information via text messages. In March, it launched an account on Facebook Inc's WhatsApp to provide users with information about the coronavirus, and it partnered with the company's Free Basics program to make some information available without users incurring data charges.

The WHO also plans to release an app next week to inform health workers globally about best practices for donning protective gear, washing hands and treating the virus. The organization already has a general app, WHO Info, that largely mirrors its website. (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Jonathan Oatis)"

With the proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices, apps have emerged as an integral part of the tech economy. Over five million apps are available for download via Apple (AAPL) iTunes app store, the Google Play Store, or Amazon (AMZN) in dozens of categories.

Some apps help people manage their finances, and some provide up-to-the-minute news of the world. Others act as a GPS, allow users to shop at their favorite stores from their phones, take pictures, send messages around the world, find somebody to date within a five-block radius, or find the best nearby bar or restaurant. Whatever you can imagine, there is probably an app for that.

Apps of all kinds have become ubiquitous, and the majority of mobile device owners use multiple apps daily. Some apps have become hugely popular, leading to success and wealth for the developers, bringing in millions or even billions of dollars. These success stories, however, are the exception, not the rule.

Key Takeaways Most app developers work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by.

Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019, though a huge majority of that revenue went to large tech companies.

While some do strike it rich, an average hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes.

The unfortunate truth is that most app developers will work hard to create the next big thing while barely scraping by in a world of ever-increasing competition and consumers with short attention spans.

Understanding Getting Rich Creating Apps

Some free apps generate revenue via in-app purchases or advertising, while others are purchased. The good news for both kinds of apps is that people use them a whole lot. ComScore's Global State of Mobile 2019 found that more than seven out of every eight minutes spent on mobile devices is app-related.

The bad news is that ComScore also found the majority of mobile device users download no new apps each month. There is, however, a small set of around 7% of smartphone users who download apps like crazy, accounting for nearly half of all monthly downloads.

Apps can be a huge source of profits. Consumers spent over $120 billion on apps in 2019. These days, there are tens of thousands of developers working independently, with start-ups, or with established companies to come up with the next big app.

The competition to develop a successful app is fierce, and there's no guarantee that even a great idea executed well will catch on and bring financial success. Even though some apps have made millionaires out of their creators, most app developers do not strike it rich, and the chances of making it big are depressingly small.

Successes

First, it is worth noting that the most popular apps—rated by unique visitors per month—are owned and operated by large technology firms like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).

There have been a few instances of small apps generating big success and making their creators exceedingly rich. Some apps have been snatched up by larger companies for huge sums of money, for example when Facebook bought Instagram, Onavo, and WhatsApp.

Square, the point of sale app, has a market cap of $32.9 billion as of mid-2020. Snapchat has a market cap of $26.15 billion. Uber and Lyft have caps of $54.6 billion and over $9.35 billion, respectively. Airbnb was worth over $38 billion at the end of 2019.

Challenges

While those valuations and sales numbers may seem encouraging, don't be fooled: the average app developer is unlikely to strike it rich. According to Forbes, the average app developer produces between three and five apps, each app bringing in an average revenue of $1,125 on Google's platform and $4,000 on Apple's.

A hard-working app maker with five apps can expect just around $20,000 a year before taxes. And that doesn't account for the money, time, and effort invested in creating those apps.

With those small revenue potentials, it is hard to build a team of developers and create advertising and marketing campaigns to increase recognition and drive downloads. There is also a huge amount of competition. For every category of app, there are numerous options to choose from, and making yours the one to gain traction can be hit or miss.

On top of all that, even with a hugely successful app, there is no guarantee that it will be able to produce a profit. It is increasingly difficult to monetize activities that many people have come to expect to be free—such as messaging, social networking, photo sharing, and cloud storage."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-reopen-u-stores-next-082701822.html,AAPL,2020-05-10T08:27:01+00:00,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) will resume operations at its retail stores in the U.S after a two-month hiatus, commencing with locations in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama, and Alaska, CNBC reported over the weekend.

The stores, which have been shut since mid-March to help contain the coronavirus spread, will operate on reduced hours and will primarily focus on repairs, with Apple encouraging customers to purchase online where possible.

“We’re excited to begin reopening stores in the US next week, starting with some stores in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama and Alaska,” an Apple representative said in a statement. “Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will.”

Apple has in recent weeks started to reopen shops in South Korea, Australia, and Germany.

Earlier this month, the iPhone maker beat the market reporting higher-than-estimated fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue despite the COVID-19 global impact, as its install base of active users reached an all-time high in all geographic segments as well as all major product categories.

Shares in Apple have recovered from this year’s low at the end of March, appreciating some 38% since and trading at $310.13 as of Friday.

Five-star analyst Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein on Thursday maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $285 price target, projecting shares will depreciate 8.1% from current levels.

""While AAPL remains expensive and has outperformed YTD, we believe the near-term and longer-term story continues to be somewhat attractive,"" Sacconaghi wrote in a note to investors.

Turning now to the rest of the analyst community, TipRanks data shows that a more bullish outlook prevails. Out of 33 Wall Street analysts, a majority of 28 assign Buys, 4 have Holds and 1 has a Sell. The $319.86 average price target indicates a mere 3.1% upside potential in the shares in the coming 12 months. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks).

Smartphone sales in China appear to have recovered in April, according to new figures released by China's Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think tank that tracks device sales.

Smartphone makers shipped 40.8 million units in April, representing a 17% increase over April 2019 and a significant improvement over February and March. However, CAICT did not break out how many units were Android phones, a figure that is often used to gauge how many Apple (AAPL) - Get Report iPhones were sold in China in a given month. Apple stock rose 0.66% on Tuesday to $317.10.

In its latest earnings report, Apple didn't give specific revenue and earnings guidance for the current quarter, but cautioned investors that iPhone results are likely to worsen compared to last quarter.

CEO Tim Cook also described a gradual recovery in China once the pandemic subsided.

Apple is reopening a handful of U.S. stories, which have been closed since mid-March, this week. Stories will operate at limited capacity and with safety precautions, such as masks and temperature checks.

The iPhone giant got a price-target boost from Wedbush Securities on Tuesday, with analyst Dan Ives writing that the rollout of the iPhone 12 this fall will “start the road to recovery” for Apple.

In a note, Ives raised his 12-month price target for Apple shares to $350 from $335 on the idea that demand for the new phone will help propel pent-up demand tied to the pandemic.

Ives estimates that about 350 million of Apple's 925 million iPhones worldwide are in an upgrade window, which bodes well for the iPhone 12 launch in the fall, he said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-accused-workers-prioritizing-chip-100000071.html,AAPL,2020-05-08T10:00:00+00:00,"(Bloomberg) --

Intel Corp. compromised worker safety at some of its factories to maintain chip production in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to complaints filed with government agencies and employees at one of the sites.At a plant in Chandler, Arizona, the world’s largest semiconductor maker did not isolate staff that worked closely with teammates who had tested positive and did not institute tests, people who work there said. Factory managers also dismissed concerns that social-distancing guidelines were not being followed properly, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they fear sanction by their employer.

Many of these virus-related concerns were also raised in filings to state agencies that regulate workplace safety. The company said it responded with new policies to improve employee safety and kept factory output high because its products are essential.

“We completely understand that people would be concerned,” said Darcy Ortiz, a vice president and general manager of corporate services within Intel’s manufacturing organization. “We have a strong safety culture. We’ve provided a means for people to escalate issues. We welcome that.”

As far as Intel is aware, there has been no transmission of the virus at a company facility. Complaints in internal forums and to state safety agencies have helped the company refine and improve its response to the pandemic, Ortiz added.

One complaint about the Chandler site was sent to the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The agency is investigating and won’t comment further until the probe is complete, said Trevor Laky, chief of legislative affairs at the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees ADOSH. It’s unclear if the regulator will take any formal action against Intel.

In Oregon, the Occupational Safety and Health division received more than 40 virus-related complaints about Intel plants in the town of Hillsboro and another nearby location. Submitted from late March to late April, the filings accuse Intel of not enforcing social-distancing rules, not providing masks to workers and letting employees with symptoms return to work without providing proof they tested negative for Covid-19, according to documents the agency shared with Bloomberg News.

Four of those complaints are still under investigation, and only one has been fully closed, according to the documents. The agency doesn’t comment until a case closes or is escalated. It said it often only has to call a company named in a complaint “to get a business to change course.”

In New Mexico, where Intel has another manufacturing site in Rio Rancho, the Occupational Health & Safety Bureau said it received two complaints that resulted in imminent danger notices being posted in the plant’s cafeteria, which was then shut down. Both investigations were closed after Intel took “satisfactory corrective action,” the agency said in documents seen by Bloomberg.

Semiconductor production lines are some of the cleanest places on the planet to prevent dust particles getting into chipmaking machines. But workers who maintain the equipment and monitor production still have to move through other parts of the plant to reach these clean rooms. There are gowning areas, for instance, where staff put on hazmat-style suits to ensure they don’t contaminate the manufacturing process.

Before Covid-19 began to spread, Intel was under pressure to ramp up production. It has struggled to switch to a new way of making smaller, more efficient chips, and spent most of last year unable to increase output enough to meet all orders from customers. Dell Inc. and Apple Inc. publicly complained about this. Semiconductor factories are run as close to flat out as possible because the expensive machinery becomes obsolete in as little as five years.

After the virus hit the U.S., managers at the Chandler facility, known as Fab 42, prioritized output over worker safety, according to employees and internal company messages seen by Bloomberg News.

In early April, on internal message boards Intel uses for employee feedback, workers asked why CDC guidelines on maintaining distances of 6 feet and wearing masks weren’t being enforced, even though there were people at Fab 42 testing positive for Covid-19. Managers said staff should stay home if they’re ill and noted that Intel would be more flexible about how time off accrues against employees’ “Personal Absence” allowance.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pandemic-moves-peer-review-twitter-154658207.html,FB,2020-05-05T15:46:58+00:00,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last June, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, Yale University and The BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) started a new “preprint server” for medical research called MedRxiv. Preprint is one term of art for an academic paper that hasn’t been peer reviewed or published yet. Working paper is another. They’ve been distributed at meetings and seminars as long as anyone can remember. In 1991, physicists began sharing theirs on the internet on a server that came to be called ArXiv (pronounced “archive”).(1) Mathematicians, astronomers, economists and scholars in a few other disciplines soon followed suit — some on ArXiv, some on other sites.

Medical researchers did not. For one thing, peer-reviewed biomedical journals publish research findings faster than those in some other fields (average time to publication is half what it is in business and economics), so the need for a speedy alternative was less pronounced. For another, medical research often involves questions of life or death that presumably deserve more pre-publication scrutiny than, say, a theoretical physics paper. And given that publishing in prestigious journals is key to career advancement, and prestigious medical journals have long made a big deal about having exclusives on new research results, researchers had legitimate worries that releasing results earlier could hurt them.

Things started off unsurprisingly slowly for MedRxiv last summer, and there wasn’t all that much sign of an acceleration over the course of 2019. Then a new coronavirus began infecting people in Wuhan, China, and, well, you can probably guess what happened next:

Page views to the MedRxiv site are now averaging 15 million a month, up from 1 million before the pandemic. Something significant has changed in medical research.

Many of the coronavirus-related papers being posted on MedRxiv are rushed and flawed, and some are terrible. But a lot report serious research findings, some of which will eventually find their way into prestigious journals, which have been softening their stance on previously released research. (“We encourage posting to preprint servers as a way to share information immediately,” emails Jennifer Zeis, director of communications at the New England Journal of Medicine.) In the meantime, the research is out there, being commented on and followed up on by other scientists, and reported on in the news media. The journals, which normally keep their content behind steep paywalls, are also offering coronavirus articles outside of it. New efforts to sort through the resulting bounty of available research are emerging, from a group of Johns Hopkins University scholars sifting manually through new Covid-19 papers to a 59,000-article machine-readable data set, requested by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and enabled by an assortment of tech corporations and academic and philanthropic organizations, that is meant to be mined for insights using artificial intelligence and other such means.

This is the future for scientific communication that has been predicted since the spread of the internet began to enable it in the early 1990s (and to some extent long before then), yet proved slow and fitful in its arrival. It involves more or less open access to scientific research and data, and a more-open review process with a much wider range of potential peers than the peer review offered by journals. For its most enthusiastic boosters, it is also an opportunity to break through disciplinary barriers, broaden and improve the standards for research success and generally just make science work better. To skeptics, it means abandoning high standards and a viable economic model for research publishing in favor of a chaotic, uncertain new approach.

I’m mostly on the side of the boosters here, but have learned during five years of writing on and off about academic publishing that the existing way of doing things is quite well entrenched, and that would-be innovators often misunderstand the challenges involved in displacing or replacing it. This moment does feel different, though. “It’s going to really be fascinating to see if this will be the tipping point,” says Heather Joseph, executive director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, an organization of academic libraries that has been pushing hard for a more open research infrastructure. “Because of the way distribution of scientific information is being piloted in a new way in the Covid crisis, my hope is that this will spill over to other areas in subsequent years,” adds Ijad Madisch, a German virologist who is founder and chief executive of ResearchGate, a social network for researchers that has seen a surge in activity and collaboration around Covid-19. “It scares me that we as scientists might just go back to doing things as we did before.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/libra-association-names-stuart-levey-163000883.html,FB,2020-05-06T16:30:00+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association, the group behind the proposed digital currency invented by Facebook Inc., named former U.S. Treasury Department official Stuart Levey as its first chief executive officer.

Levey has been chief legal officer at London-based bank HSBC Holdings Plc since 2012. As leader of the Libra Association, he will work with global regulators to push the project forward -- a daunting task that already led the group to revise its plans for releasing a digital coin. The association is currently working with regulators in Europe and the U.S. to obtain the necessary payment licenses.

Before joining HSBC, Levey was under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department, where he helped “combat illicit finance,” the Libra Association said Wednesday in a statement. Much of the skepticism about Libra has centered on concerns that the coin could be used for illegal activity.

Libra, which was announced in June 2019, was conceived and developed by Facebook, the world’s largest social network. It’s now governed by a 24-member independent coalition of companies and nonprofits, though the group has changed since the project was launched. Levey will assume the role sometime this summer, and will be stationed in Washington. The Libra Association, based in Geneva, said last month that it aims to have its coins ready in late 2020.

As the coronavirus sell-off and emerging rebound have shown in recent months, you want to make sure each of the ""three big rocks of CAN SLIM"" are in place before you invest. Following that one simple step will help you stay both profitable and protected.

In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.

To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:

As you review these examples, be sure to note how NFLX stock, NVDA stock, FB stock have also returned to their positions of stock market leadership after suffering damage to their charts in the coronavirus sell-off.

Best Stocks To Buy — And When To Buy Them

When looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.

Market Direction: The best time to buy stocks is when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market outlook is ""uptrend under pressure"" or ""market in correction,"" it's best to keep your powder dry and wait for a new rally to take hold. (Here's how to easily check current market conditions.)

So be sure to focus on stocks that fit that bill. (See the seven traits of winning stocks.) Chart Action: Bases are like launchpads that reignite a stock and lift it higher after it's taken a rest. If you stay patient and wait for a stock to form and break out of a chart pattern, you significantly reduce your risk and still leave significant potential upside. (Here's how to find stocks near potential buy points.)

So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (also called technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.

Chart Patterns: Cup With Handle

From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.

The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% to 30%.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with the first down week).

Handle: at least five days long (count starts with first down day).

Buy point: peak in the handle, plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).

The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.

Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.

On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.

Nvidia Breakout From Cup With Handle

When Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.

The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.

Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.

From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose 750% over the next 29 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.

Showing reslienced and resumed market leadership, NVDA stock has reboounded from a sell-off that began in October 2018 and is now back to trading near an all-time high.

Chart Patterns: Double Bottom

The double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.

Here's what to look for in a double bottom:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 40% or less.

Base length: at least seven weeks (starting with first down week).

Peak in middle of W: should form in the upper half of the base and should be below the left-side peak.

Undercut: the bottom of second leg down should be lower than the bottom of the first leg down.

Buy point: 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.

Facebook Breakout From Double Bottom

Like many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.

Chart Patterns: Flat Base

As the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.

Here are the key elements of a flat base:

Prior uptrend: at least 30%.

Base depth: 15% or less.

Base length: at least five weeks (starting with the first down week).

Buy point: the peak in the base (typically on the left side of the pattern), plus 10 cents.

Buy range: up to 5% above the ideal buy point.

Netflix Breakout From Flat Base

Netflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.

After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.

Attorneys general for several U.S. states are requesting more information from Amazon on conditions and the company's warehouses.

AGs from 13 states, led by Massachusetts AG Maura Healey, sent a letter to Amazon on Tuesday asking for details of health and safety measures, compliance with state paid sick leave laws and information about worker infections and deaths from COVID-19. Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report shares fell 2.2% on Tuesday to $2,357.22.

The letter expressed concern over news reports of inadequate conditions and sick leave policies at Amazon warehouses, worker infections and deaths and retaliation against employees who called out unsafe practices.

COVID-19 cases have been reported at several U.S. Amazon warehouses, including as many as 30 cases at a warehouse in New Jersey. A 60 Minutes investigation found that 600 Amazon workers had tested positive for coronavirus, including six who later died.

“Amazon and Whole Foods must take every possible step to protect their employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Healey in a statement. “We again call on these companies to provide assurances that they are complying with state laws and federal guidance aimed at keeping essential workers safe during this crisis.”

Tim Bray, a longtime executive at Amazon, quit ""in dismay"" last week over the company's dismissal of workers who spoke out against conditions at warehouses.

""Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power,"" Bray wrote in an open letter.

In response to increased demand for home delivery, Amazon is in the process of hiring 175,000 new workers.

Amazon shares have risen 24% year to date.

For many, dividends provide a steady and, hopefully, rising income stream, no matter what's going on with the stock market.

Or so many think.

Of course, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies in travel and leisure, airlines, and oil and gas are cutting their payouts. Even the mighty Disney (NYSE:DIS) is suspending its next biannual dividend. It could do more.

However, the danger I'm talking about isn't related to the coronavirus. Once the virus subsides, dividend investors should also be aware of the big risk that applies to all dividend stocks, regardless of industry, debt levels, or payout ratio.

Don't get blindsided

Once a company gets to a certain size and scale, it usually starts paying a dividend. This typically happens after a company has achieved some success. As the good times roll on and the company grows, companies usually feel pressure to raise those dividends every year. If they don't, dissatisfaction among investors can grow. Management doesn't like disappointing investors, and many companies have declared their dividends sacrosanct. This is especially true once a business becomes a Dividend Aristocrat, a company that's raised its dividend annually for at least 25 straight years. Once you're anointed an Aristocrat, it's hard to be demoted to something less than!

However, there may come a point at which the dividend, which is a cash outflow to the business, becomes a burden rather than a bonus. While any one dividend payment is unlikely to change a company's trajectory, a high and growing dividend may cause a business to under-invest in its business over time.

In the worst case, under-investment can leave a seemingly ""safe"" company vulnerable to disruption. Disruption usually comes from young, hungry growth companies without dividend burdens that aim to reshape an industry in a new and better way.

Disruptive companies tend reinvest all profits -- and perhaps even more -- into the business. And if successful, disruptive growth companies can be such massive long-term winners that their returns more than make up for the lack of dividend, sometimes by staggering amounts.

Don't believe me? Here are several examples.

Netflix disrupts big media

There was once a time in which big media stocks were among the best, most-coveted companies in the world. These cable and broadcast companies receive affiliate revenues from distributors and advertising revenues from large companies looking to reach their massive audiences. That led to big-time growth in the 1990s and early 2000s, with high profits and dividends aplenty.

Then came Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disrupted the entire media landscape by introducing over-the-top, commercial-free internet streaming for a low monthly fee. While many of the legacy media companies were growing fat on their profits, and often paying dividends, Netflix instead reinvested all of its revenue into producing more and more content. In fact, not only did Netflix spend all its revenue, but it also spent more than that, taking on incremental debt to fund original content, while also paying hefty licensing fees to partners.

Legacy media were hesitant to disrupt their own highly profitable businesses, which allowed Netflix to gain a substantial head start. Now, it may be too late for others to catch up.

The result? Most legacy media companies have seen big declines in their share prices, while others have merged with large cable or telecom companies, basically ""selling out"" before things got worse. Meanwhile, Netflix's stock has gone on to trounce the competition.

T-Mobile disrupts big telecom

The same story has played out in the telecom space as well. For many years, the ""big two"" telecom networks of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) enjoyed an effective duopoly, with the nation's two leading mobile networks. Their high and rising dividends also made them very popular safe-haven picks for retirees and other dividend investors.

Enter T-Mobile USA (NASDAQ:TMUS), the U.S. telecom majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY). After a merger with smaller carrier MetroPCS in 2013, T-Mobile underwent a substantial rebranding campaign as the ""Un-Carrier"" under CEO John Legere. T-Mobile spent big on the customer experience, offering affordable plans and doing away with usual industry pain points, such as annual contracts, overage charges, and hidden taxes and fees.

Meanwhile, T-Mobile continued to invest heavily in its networks, never paying a dividend, bringing its quality closer and closer to par with the big boys. Now that T-Mobile was finally able to merge with fourth-place carrier Sprint, the combined company actually has a chance at leap-frogging the two leaders in the race to a superior 5G network.

In its just-reported quarter, T-Mobile continued to rack up market share gains, with 777,000 postpaid net additions and 7% branded postpaid revenue growth on top of 5% revenue growth. While not exactly a highflier, that represented about 70% of the entire industry growth during the quarter, and the 25th quarter in a row that T-Mobile has led the industry in net addition growth.

While you would have enjoyed the dividends from AT&T and Verizon over the past five years, T-Mobile's disruption would have led to even bigger overall gains.

Amazon disrupts... everyone

Finally, perhaps the most disruptive stock in the world is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has gone on to disrupt not one but two large and profitable industries. The first is traditional brick-and-mortar retail, especially mall-based retail, which used to enjoy fat profit margins, big dividends, and buybacks.

However, Amazon led the e-commerce industry in building out a first-class online experience, including a huge selection of inventory and fast shipping times. This was all turbocharged by Amazon's Prime offering, which offered free two-day shipping on most goods for an annual subscription fee, which ""locked"" customers into its ecosystem.

Of course, offering low prices and high customer satisfaction cost a lot of money, and Amazon has never paid a dividend. In fact, in most years of its corporate life, Amazon either broke even or lost money. However, that didn't stop the stock from going on to greater and greater heights as it racked up more and more revenue and market share:

But Amazon wasn't content to disrupt only retail. Perhaps more consequential was Amazon's disruption of the enterprise technology space, specifically by inventing the concept of cloud computing. While high-touch consulting and on-premises technology management made traditional enterprise IT services a very profitable business, the public cloud has allowed enterprises greater flexibly, affordability, and access to the latest technology on a per-use basis. That's taken market share away from many big IT companies that used to ""rule"" enterprise IT and pay out large dividends, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).

For those who say disruptive businesses don't ever make a profit, the Amazon Web Services cloud computing division just reported 33% growth, with operating margins above 30% last quarter, proving that even disruptors can be profitable, given enough time.

Even Berkshire Hathaway is looking to disrupt utilities

Longtime fans of Warren Buffett know that his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) has never paid dividends. While the primary reason is to give Buffett and his partners as much capital as possible to make market-beating investments, the lack of a dividend also allows Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries to invest as much as they can or want without capital constraints.

One case in point is Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a subsidiary created when Berkshire bought MidAmerican Energy in 1999. Under Berkshire, MidAmerican has grown into an industry leader, often with superior service and lower prices than its competitors. In fact, in last year's annual letter to shareholders, Buffett informed shareholders that, thanks to huge past investments in wind energy, Berkshire's Iowa utility beats its main competitor's electricity rates by a stunning 70%!

At this year's annual meeting, Buffett and likely successor Greg Abel outlined another $100 billion of investment opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway Energy in the coming years, because of the need for updates energy infrastructure in the U.S. -- to which Buffett added (emphasis mine):

[W]e're better positioned than anybody in the energy business just because we don't have dividend requirements. We retained 28 billion of earnings over 20 years. You can't do it if you run a normal public company. And we've got a huge appetite, and the country needs it; the world needs it.

Don't ignore dividend stocks, but make sure they're protected

As these examples show, disruptive competitors without dividend burdens can make extraordinary gains for shareholders at the expense of incumbent dividend payers. In retrospect, you would have been better off buying any of these disruptors, and then perhaps selling a few shares every year instead of depending on regular dividend payouts. So that's another method to consider in lieu of a dividend strategy.

Of course, this doesn't mean you should ignore dividends altogether. After all, Buffett himself also owns a lot of dividend stocks. However, if you own a stock for its dividend, you need to ask if there are potential disruptive threats to the business, and if the business is making all the investments it needs to grow and adapt.

The main point is, dividends and dividend growth can't overcome superior business strategies and better customer experiences. So, dividend investors, make sure the companies in your portfolio provide these, whether they pay a dividend or not!"

Tesla Fremont Plant Lawsuit

The Tesla Fremont plant, the electric vehicle maker's main manufacturing facility, has been shut down since March 23 due to coronavirus shutdown orders in Alameda County. Tesla had planned to reopen the Fremont plant on Friday after Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom said manufacturing could resume in the state. But Newsom said local orders remain in effect and Alameda said Tesla can't reopen. Its current order closing nonessential businesses runs through May 31.

Tesla filed a lawsuit in federal court Saturday, saying the shutdown order has ""no rational basis"" and that the local order shouldn't trump state rules.

Hours earlier, Elon Musk tweeted that he'll move Tesla's headquarters and future efforts out of the state, and perhaps shutter its Fremont plant.

Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020

An Alameda County supervisor said Saturday that the county and Tesla had been close to a deal to reopen the Fremont plant on May 18, but Musk wanted to open on Friday, May 8.

General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) plan to reopen U.S. plants on May 18. Toyota (TM) will open its U.S. plants on May 11 while Mercedes-Benz has reopened factories in the South. Automakers are already operating several European plants.

The long Tesla Fremont plant closure raises questions about cash burn. But it also highlights longer-term questions about the Fremont plant, or any other U.S. manufacturing site.

Tesla China Sales Fall Sharply

Tesla sold just 3,635 Model 3 vehicles in China last month, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That's a 64% drop from the 10,160 sold in March. That came even as Tesla Shanghai made well over 10,000 Model 3 sedans.

Sales may have slowed due to a Tesla price cut set to take effect to qualify for revised subsidies. Tesla also began taking orders last month for made-in-China higher-end Model 3 sedans.

Tesla Shanghai has been on an extended shutdown to start May.

If the China growth story wavers, Tesla stock could face real trouble, especially with the Fremont plant closed.

China electric vehicle sales overall rebounded in April vs. March. Nio (NIO), the so-called Tesla in China, sold 3,155 luxury electric SUVs last month, more than double its March sales pace.

Tesla stock, which has rallied in recent months on China growth and on Friday on Fremont plant hopes, fell modestly early Monday.

Microsoft Stock, Netflix Stock: Earnings And Chill

Meanwhile, the current stock market rally continues to gain momentum. Many leading stocks are now extended. But Microsoft stock, Insulet stock and Chipotle stock are all in buy range. Vertex stock and Netflix stock are extended from breakouts, but are just below possible new entries.

All five of these stocks have already reported earnings, so that major risk is off the table for months.

Microsoft stock, Vertex stock and Netflix stock boast best-possible IBD Composite Ratings of 99. Chipotle has a strong 93 Composite Rating. Insulet stock has an 81 CR, but analysts are betting on revived earnings later this year. Tesla stock has a 97 Composite Rating.

The relative strength lines for all of these stocks, including TSLA stock, are at or near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, track a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

MSFT stock, CMG stock, VRTX stock and NFLX stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is PODD stock rival Dexcom (DXCM). Vertex stock, Netflix stock and Microsoft stock also are on SwingTrader. Netflix stock and Vertex stock are on the IBD 50 list.

Microsoft stock is a founding member of the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide have topped 4.20 million. Covid-19 deaths are at least 284,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have exceeded 1.36 million, with deaths reaching 80,000.

New coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose by 20,329 on Sunday, the smallest gain since March 29. Keep in mind that reported new cases tend to be lower on Sunday. Still, it's encouraging. New coronavirus cases in the U.S. have plateaued for several weeks, but that's partly due to a continued increase in testing. The share of positive Covid-19 tests has fallen dramatically in the last few weeks.

States are reopening their battered economies at various speeds. It's possible these moves will spur a new wave of infections, but testing, continued social distancing and mask-wearing may counter that.

On the flip side, several White House staffers have tested positive for Covid-19 in recent days.

Meanwhile, Russia has more than 220,000 coroanvirus cases, with big daily increases. In the past several days it's surpassed France and Germany and is in the process of overtaking the U.K., Italy and soon Spain. Brazil and India area among other notable countries with big increases in confirmed Covid-19 cases.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The current stock market rally had a powerful, entering a bullish power trend.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% last, the S&P 500 index 3.5% and the Nasdaq composite 6%. The Nasdaq is now positive for the year again, with its 50-day moving average moving higher.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) jumped 6.9%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) soared 9%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 7.2%.

Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock jumped 5.8% last week to 184.68. That's still in buy range from an 180.10 handle from a double-bottom base. Microsoft earnings on Aug. 29 were better than expected, with revenue growth the best in six quarters. Cloud-related revenue led the way, with Azure cloud-computing services revenue up 62%.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock pulled back from record highs after earnings, retreating to the top of its prior base but staging a bullish upside reversal. Netflix stock rose 4.9% last week to 435.55. That's near the top of its recent consolidation. At three weeks, that's far too short to be a proper base. But investors could treat 449.62 as a Netflix stock entry.

Q1 earnings on April 21 missed views but Netflix subscriber growth surged as people stuck at home and movie theaters closed spurred people to stream Netflix.

Chipotle Stock

Chipotle stock rose 3.2% on Friday to 925.83, clearing a 909.98 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. CMG stock rallied 5.8% last week.

Chipotle earnings fell in Q1, but beat views. Same-store sales climbed xxx despite. Digital sales surged 81%, with CEO Brian Niccol saying he sees signs of ""cooking fatigue"" among Americans. Chipotle stock surged 12% on April 22, the day after earnings.

Vertex Stock

Vertex stock pulled back heading into earnings, undercutting a 249.95 cup-base buy point a few times but never closing below that level. But in the days after its Aug. 29 earnings report, Vertex stock rebounded, once again clearing the buy zone. VRTX stock climbed 6.6% last week to 271.63. Much like Netflix stock, Vertex stock would be actionable is it clears a short consolidation. That Vertex stock buy point is 277.90.

Vertex earnings skyrocketed 125% in Q1, blowing out views, with sales up 76%. The biotech giant also raised guidance, highly unusual in the current environment.

Insulet Stock

Insulet stock cleared a 209.94 cup-with-handle buy point last Thursday, just before earnings after the close. PODD stock initially tumbled on Friday, falling as low as 200, but then reversed higher, ultimately closing up 1.15% to 217.63. Insulet stock shot up nearly 12% for the week.

Insulet lost 3 cents share in Q1, worse than expected. Revenue topped views, but the insulin pump maker trimmed full-year revenue targets. Wall Street does seem improving Insulet earnings in the next few quarters.

The diabetes product space is doing well, a plus for Insulet stock. But the leader in that space appears to be Dexcom stock, which is greatly extended from a base.

Tesla Fremont's Future

Elon Musk clearly wants to pressure Alameda County to let Tesla Fremont reopen quickly. If Musk did decide to shift Tesla manufacturing to another site — perhaps as part of a Cybertruck facility — several states would likely offer subsidies. But a new plant would still take 12-18 months. Moving manufacturing from California, easily the biggest state for Tesla sales, could hurt the brand among its core customers.

Meanwhile, there are questions about the longer-term future for any Tesla auto plant in the U.S.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Tesla Fremont facility accounted for all the company's electric-vehicle production, aside from a handful of Model 3 sedans from the brand-new Shanghai site. U.S. demand was weakening. But China demand was strong, while Tesla was still expanding into some European markets and expiring subsidies fueled demand in countries in Netherlands.

But in the first quarter, the Shanghai plant ramped up production, increasingly addressing China demand. U.S. demand remained soft, even with an early Model Y launch. In Europe, sales fell in many countries, with Tesla's market share declining significantly. Several EVs have launched in Europe this year, with the Volkswagen ID.3 line due this summer. Tesla has no more European markets to enter.

In the near term, auto sales overall may be weak in the U.S. and Europe due to their massive recessions. But even after an economic recovery, with Tesla sales already well off their highs in the U.S. and possibly peaking in Europe, will ex-China demand be strong enough to keep the Fremont plant busy?

Keep in mind that Tesla plans to build another factory outside Berlin. While construction hasn't started yet, Tesla aims to have Giga Berlin up and running by 2021.

So in little more than two years, the Tesla Fremont plant is set to shift from serving the world serving expanding new markets to essentially just the U.S.

Down the road, Tesla will have incentives to export autos from its Shanghai plant, taking further production from Fremont. If Tesla Shanghai production exceeds China demand, the pressure will build quickly.

If you're a Tesla bull, you can see huge growth and continued strong share in booming electric vehicle market. But if that doesn't come to pass, Tesla production capacity could soon far exceed demand.

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock fell 2.5% before the open Monday. Shares rose 5% to 819.42 on Friday on Fremont plant reopening hopes. TSLA stock shot up 17% for the week.

If the Fremont plant opens relatively soon, the Tesla stock impact may be relatively minor. But the longer the Tesla Fremont plant is closed, the bigger the drain on the company's cash will be. Meanwhile, Tesla's China sales are an issue.

It's not clear what a proper Tesla stock entry would be. Tesla stock broke out past a 775.05 handle entry in late April. But shares then reversed lower on April 30 and plunged further on May 1, invalidating that buy point. Tesla stock did find support at its 21-day line and rebounded last week. One could view the chart and see a new handle, with a Tesla stock buy point of 869.92.

But the base is extremely deep and volatile. Together with significant uncertainty about Tesla production now and demand in the coming months, investors may want to await more clarity.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/07/peacock-launch-exceeded-comcast-expectations.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,NFLX,2020-05-07T00:00:00,"Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) launched Peacock -- its ad-supported streaming service -- to Xfinity video and internet subscribers last month. During Comcast's first-quarter earnings call on April 30, management said the limited rollout exceeded its expectations.

""We're already pacing ahead of our internal forecast on monthly active users and in time spent viewing,"" CEO Brian Roberts told investors.

Before investors get too excited thinking Peacock is the next Disney+ (NYSE:DIS), there are a few points of caution. First of all, Peacock launched amid a boom in streaming video demand. Second, Comcast's expectations were very low. And finally, management gave no plans to move up the broader launch date (still scheduled for July) despite the successful soft-launch.

The perfect time to launch a streaming service

It's no surprise that customers are spending more time than expected watching shows and films on Peacock. Consumers are spending more time than ever streaming video as they stay at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sports games are postponed, and the broadcast television schedule is becoming increasingly sparse as spring seasons wrap up.

Video streaming to TVs climbed 85% year over year in the first three weeks of March, according to data from Nielsen. And that's before stay-at-home orders were fully in place. April likely saw an even bigger jump in streaming hours.

There's substantial demand for premium streaming content. Disney launched Disney+ in Europe and India at the end of March and early April, and added about 20 million subscribers in just a matter of days. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) just had its best quarter ever, adding nearly 16 million subscribers. So, Comcast is far from the only one seeing strong results from a streaming service.

Setting a low bar

Comcast has relatively modest expectations for Peacock. When it unveiled its plans in January, management forecast 30 million to 35 million U.S. viewers by 2024. To put that in perspective, Disney+ reached 28 million (mostly U.S.) subscribers within three months of launching. Netflix has over 60 million paid subscribers in the U.S.

Not only does Comcast expect low total viewership, it seems to expect relatively low engagement as well. It expects average ad revenue per viewer to be about half that of Disney's ad-supported Hulu viewers. That's despite similar ad loads, pre-existing sales channels and relationships, and good ad technology. In other words, it expects relatively low engagement.

So the fact that Comcast is seeing higher-than-expected numbers of active users and hours spent streaming doesn't say much. That's especially true considering it comes during a time of increased demand for free ad-supported streaming video services.

Why not move up the launch date?

It's a bit concerning that Comcast isn't moving up the broader launch date for Peacock. There are several reasons it's in the media company's best interest to launch as soon as possible. Peacock chairman Matt Strauss even said he wants to bring Peacock to market as quickly as possible last month.

But when asked why the company isn't moving up the launch, NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell responded: ""We don't see the value and we're not trying to gain subscribers. And we want to make sure the product is right before we launch in July. So this is kind of a measured strategy on our part, and I think it's the right strategy for Peacock.""

More likely, Comcast is working with other pay-TV distributors to offer Peacock to their subscribers at no extra cost. And it's been negotiating with them under the assumption of a July launch. Launching without those partnerships would ultimately produce a very disappointing result. Still, it seems like there's room to accelerate those negotiations and move up the launch.

It seems curious management isn't making any effort to launch earlier despite the early success and window of opportunity for Peacock. Combined with the relatively low expectations management had for the streaming service, investors shouldn't get too excited about management's comments."
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/distress-signals-are-flashing-in-us-commercial-real-estate-but-will-it-need-a-talf-rescue-2020-05-07?siteid=yhoof2,AAPL,2020-05-07T00:00:00,"Hotel rooms, office buildings and other commercial properties were lonely places last month as much of the nation operated under stay-at-home orders.

Being a property owner might have made the lockdowns feel even lonelier.

But as regions of the U.S. begin exploring ways to lift restrictive measures to contain the coronavirus and resume business, there is still plenty of uncertainty around what the toll will be on commercial properties, particularly since new protocols for returning to work, visiting the dentist and dining out are still being formed.

Read: U.S. commercial real estate braces for defaults as pandemic cuts cash flows

Barry Sternlicht, chief executive officer of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. STWD, -2.67% , this week described how hotels might begin resuming operations. “I think hotels, all hotels, will figure out how to operate with lower breakevens with fewer less-profitable parts,” he said during the real-estate company’s first-quarter earnings call.

“There won’t be restaurants, there may not be room service, but they will try to fill heads and beds and staff to demand.”

And yet, commercial property owners are starting to see a key funding spigot, namely the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities, a type of property bond, stage a limited comeback after the sector froze in March as the pandemic took hold in the U.S.

“CMBS is starting to show signs of life,” Jake Remley, senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management told MarketWatch, while underscoring that some new bond deals have excluded hard-hit property types, namely hotel loans.

By contrast, a range of highly rated U.S. companies, including retail giant Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.14% , have borrowed a record amount in the corporate bond market through the start of this year, effectively socking away cash to offset what may be several painful quarters of business.

Read: Apple borrows $8.5 billion, joins record corporate debt borrowing spree

Those floodgates opened only after the Federal Reserve unleased its balance sheet to shore up financial markets, including laying out plans in March to buy U.S. corporate debt for the first time ever, through a series of emergency funding programs. Later, its plans were expanded to include speculative-grade, or junk-rated, company debt, which are expected to start soon.

The program open to CMBS is the Fed’s $100 billion Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, of TALF 2.0, as it’s known on Wall Street.

See: How the Fed plans to keep credit, a crux of the American economy, flowing to U.S. consumers during the pandemic

But unlike the Fed’s corporate debt facilities, TALF’s current scope is more restrictive and excludes newly issued and riskier CMBS with below-investment-grade credit ratings.

“The Fed is signaling they’re willing to support liquidity,” Remley said. But he also said the central bank is sending a message that not all types of debt are welcome, since eligibility is partially dependent on ratings. “That is going to create winners and losers and have some knock-on effects in the economy.”

Terms still could change once the facility gets up and running.

Of note, the original version of TALF for CMBS didn’t really get off the ground until about September 2009, following the 2007-’08 global financial crisis, and only ended up funding about $12 billion in loans to 87 borrowers before markets stabilized, according to a report this week from Deutsche Bank analysts.

Their chart below shows the top 10 CMBS TALF borrowers from a decade ago.

Top borrowers during the last crisis. Deutsche Bank

A dozen debt players, including BlackRock Inc. BLK, -7.84% and Voya Financial Inc. VOYA, -3.88% recently have been exploring their options in terms of investing alongside the Fed through new TALF funds, according to a Bloomberg report.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald estimated a few weeks ago that returns, using leverage, could range from 6.5% to more than 20% for TALF borrowers. But that was before spreads, or the premium investors get paid over a risk-free benchmark on bonds, came crashing in from their widest recent levels.

Deutsche Bank analysts pegged 10-year AAA-rated CMBS spreads at a 52-week high of 318 basis points, which as of this week narrowed to closer to 150 basis points.

Meanwhile, U.S. stocks, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.88% , continue to recover, as the Fed works to kick off TALF. Other sources of lending for distressed real estate are emerging too.

Real estate giant Brookfield Asset Management Inc. BAM, -3.47% wants to spend $5 billion to shore up retailers hit by coronavirus fallout, using its own balance sheet, existing funds and investment strategies, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

And if CMBS spreads stay compressed it would mean less upside for TALF funds, since borrowers are slated to pay the Fed 125 basis points to 150 basis points over a risk-free benchmark for access to its short term loans.

“In two weeks, the market has tightened,” Remley said. “There’s still interesting in TALF, but it’s waning to a degree.”"

The coronavirus stock market rally has come a long way from March lows. The Nasdaq is not far from all-time highs, led by Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big techs.

ServiceNow stock and Microsoft stock are in buy zones now. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are setting up new entries, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are closing in on buy points.

But is the stock market rally disconnected from the grim economic reality? That may not be the right question for investors.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value, but off their worst levels. S&P 500 futures sank 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.3%. In the coronavirus stock market rally, Dow Jones futures have been less volatile than during the market crash. But Dow futures can still show some notable swings.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 4.34 million. Covid-19 deaths are at least 292,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped 1.4 million, with deaths above 83,000. U.S. coronavirus cases in the past two days have hit their lowest levels in weeks. Coronavirus testing has increased substantially, with the share of positive tests falling. Much of the improvement in terms of new cases has come in the New York/New Jersey area.

Dr. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, cited concerns about reopening certain parts of the country. Los Angeles County extended its stay-at-home order by another three months. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials warned of business failures on a ""grand scale.""

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally pulled back, closing at session lows on some of those coronavirus shutdown headlines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.9% and the S&P 500 index 2.05%. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.1%, snapping a six-session win streak with an outside day, downside reversal.

Apple stock, a Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq component, retreated 1.1%, also breaking its six-day win streak. The relative strength line for Apple stock hit a record high.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) slid 2.6%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 2.35%. Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are big IGV holdings. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 2.75%, with Nvidia and AMD notable members

The coronavirus stock market rally arguably has been due for a pullback. But should it be a lot lower?

Stock Market Rally Disconnect From Economic Reality?

Many argue that there's a disconnect between the coronavirus stock market rally from the economic reality of a massive recession and joblessness. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and will shed millions more in May. Unemployment is expected to top 20% at a minimum. There are some positive signs while states and countries are starting to open up, but until there's a vaccine much of the economy will be in a lower gear or shut down entirely.

So is the coronavirus stock market rally divorced from reality? Let's take a closer look.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Winners

The big stock market rally winners during the coronavirus crisis aren't a surprise. Many are just outright coronavirus plays: Zoom Video (ZM), Moderna (MRNA), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Peloton Interactive (PTON), along with Netflix stock, Amazon stock and Shopify stock.

Meanwhile, AMD stock, Microsoft stock, ServiceNow stock, Nvidia (NVDA), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and many others — especially software — are benefiting in various ways from the stay-at-home trend, helping people hold up or even thrive in the coronavirus crisis.

Further down, there are internet giants Facebook stock and Google stock as well as digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL). Facebook and Google are seeing strong demand from people stuck at home. PayPal is benefiting from people adopting digital payments. Facebook stock, Google stock and PayPal stock may do especially well in a world of continued social distancing but with a recovery in advertising and consumer spending.

Likewise, Apple stock and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) have broken out. Apple and Lululemon are upscale consumer discretionary companies. In the midst of a deep recession where people have been stuck at home, status-enhancing discretionary purchases would seem at risk. But, to be blunt, many people who buy Apple and Lululemon products haven't lost their well-paying jobs. If these consumers feel confident that the economy will improve, they're willing to spend today.

Also, some medicals are doing well, seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, such as Dexcom (DXCM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Finally, a few consumer products companies like Clorox (CLX) and General Mills (GIS) were plodding along before the coronavirus crisis but have seen demand spike for cleaning products, cereal and soup.

So there's a good argument for all of these stocks to be doing well. In other words, the leading stocks in the coronavirus market rally don't seem disconnected from their companies' reality.

Given the heft of Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Netflix stock, Amazon stock, Nvidia stock, AMD stock, Facebook stock, Google stock, PayPal stock, Shopify stock, ServiceNow stock, along with many other coronavirus market rally winners, it's easy to see why the Nasdaq composite is doing so well.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Losers

Meanwhile, plenty of ""real economy"" market sectors have been badly hit: travel, leisure, energy, manufacturing and many retailers and financials. Many of these sectors are shut down.

Most of these companies were struggling before the coronavirus with beaten-down stocks. The market cap on many of these stocks is fairly low. Macy's (M), the nation's largest department store chain, has a market cap of $1.55 billion. Contrast that to Microsoft stock, with a market cap of $1.38 trillion. So solid advances by megacap techs such as Microsoft, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock can offset much bigger losses by companies with lower valuations.

Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, with more ""real economy"" stocks than the Nasdaq, have made far less progress in the coronavirus stock market rally.

Keep in mind that the stock market is made up of major companies, with most ""small-cap stocks"" small relative to the giants, but still fairly substantial operations. The stock market is not a microcosm of the overall economy, with the millions of truly small businesses struggling to survive.

Yes, The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Is Surprising

All that being said, it is surprising to see the stock market rally so quickly toward highs, even setting aside the economy. The old saying is that markets fall on an elevator and rise on an escalator. But the current stock market rally has run up almost as fast as the market crash.

The fact that the U.S. economy is suffering a historic contraction amid a still active pandemic makes the pace of the stock market rally even more surprising.

Follow, Don't Fight The Stock Market

But you want to pay attention to what the stock market is doing right now. Don't try to impose your opinions on it. The stock market doesn't care what you or I think.

Perhaps the market will re-evaluate the economic and earnings outlook to the downside, via a grim economic report, big corporate warning or a spike in coronavirus cases.

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock market move sideways for several weeks or pull back, at least somewhat.

Then again, maybe the stock market rally will surge into new high ground and beyond.

No matter what happens, if you're following the coronavirus market rally via the major indexes and leading stocks, you'll be ready to move with the stock market trend. Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Top Stocks To Watch

Microsoft stock, AMD stock, ServiceNow stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are all on IBD Leaderboard. So is Apple stock, which is modestly extended. Meanwhile, Facebook stock, AMD stock and Apple stock are on SwingTrader.

NFLX stock, FB stock, AMD stock and NOW stock are all IBD 50 members, along with several other stock market rally winners cited above.

Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.

ServiceNow Stock

ServiceNow stock fell 4.7% to 365.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading. NOW stock is still above the 363.05 cup-base buy point. A pullback toward the buy point is normal, especially with race-from-the-bottom cup patterns.

The relative strength line for ServiceNow stock is still near record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ServiceNow stock can be bought now, or perhaps at 388.60, just above Monday's all-time high.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock fell 2.3% to 182.51. MSFT stock is in range from a 180.10 handle on a double-bottom base. The RS line for Microsoft stock is at record highs.

Microsoft stock has the largest valuation of any U.S.-listed company. It just edges out Apple stock, which is at $1.35 trillion. Amazon stock follows at $1.18 trillion and Google stock at $939 billion.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock sank 2% to 431.82. NFLX stock is extended from an April breakout, but has been consolidating for a few weeks. It's not long enough for a proper base, but 449.62 could serve as an entry point for Netflix stock. A stock market rally pause or pullback could offer more time for NFLX stock to form a traditional consolidation.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock sank 2.2% to 2,356.95. Like Netflix stock, AMZN stock has been consolidating for a few weeks, though the e-commerce and cloud-computing services giant popped to a record 1,475 on April 30 just before earnings. Amazon stock fell on the earnings miss and weak guidance, but has remained in its recent range. A move above the old high would offer an entry point for Amazon stock.

AMD Stock

AMD stock sank 3.55%. The chipmaker is working on a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. AMD stock recently lagged some other data-center chipmakers, such as Nvidia stock and Inphi (IPHI), but may be perking up again. AMD earnings per share surged 300% and 200% in the last two quarters.

Facebook Stock

Facebook stock dipped 1.4% to 210.10. FB stock is steadily moving toward a V-shape consolidation with a 224.30 buy point. The relative strength line for Facebook stock has ramped up sharply in the last few weeks. Facebook stock once again on Tuesday was a ""Blue Dot"" stock, signifying stocks in bases with RS lines at new highs. They are identified on MarketSmith charts with a blue-shaded dot at the end of their RS lines.

A coronavirus stock market rally pause could offer a chance for Facebook stock to build a handle.

Google Stock

Google stock fell 2% to 1,375.18. A cup base with a 1,530.84 buy point has formed for GOOGL stock. Google stock, like FANG peer Facebook's stock, is a Blue Dot special today.

The post-coronavirus stock market rally has been powerful, in large part thanks to big-cap techs such as Apple stock and the four FANG internet giants. Netflix stock and Amazon stock are obvious coronavirus plays. Facebook stock and Google stock are seeing heavy usage, though ad spending is a concern. Apple stock delivered a surprise EPS gain, despite its exposure to coronavirus supply and demand issues.

Top Stocks To Buy And Watch

One way to find the best stocks is to look at their IBD Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

Netflix stock is at the top with a perfect 99 out of 99 Composite Rating. Amazon stock and Facebook stock both have 98 ratings. Alphabet stock has a 95 rating and Apple stock has a 90 rating.

Investors should be focusing on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher but it isn't the only metric investors should keep track of.

Apple stock, Amazon stock and Netflix stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Facebook stock, Google stock and AAPL stock are on SwingTrader.

Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the coronavirus stock market rally on IBD Live.

Facebook Stock

Facebook is the FANG stock closest to being actionable as it forms a cup base with a 224.30 entry point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The FB stock base is 39% deep. Largely that's above what investors should typically be after. But it's not unusual following the huge stock market crash. Facebook stock edged up 0.5% to 212.35 on Friday, climbing 5% for the week.

The relative strength line for Facebook stock is already at new highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500.

On April 29, Facebook reported first-quarter earnings that were mostly in line with expectations. Monthly active users climbed 10% to 2.6 billion as the users logged on the social media site to stay connected amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the company also warned that the increased user activity wouldn't protect it from the pullback it's seeing in online advertising revenue.

Google Stock

The next FANG stock closest to being actionable is Google, which is forming a cup base and closing in on a 1,530.84 buy point. Google stock had fallen 34% from its high on March 23 as fears rose over the Covid-19 outbreak. But the RS line for GOOGL stock hit a new high Friday.

Google stock rose 1.1% to 1,384.34 on Friday, also up 5% for the week.

The parent of Google reported mixed Q1 results last month as advertising revenue from the travel, auto and retail sectors fell. But YouTube revenue rose 33% to $4.038 billion, while Google Cloud revenue surged 52%.

Netflix Stock

Netflix stock is extended from either a 383.11 buy point or 393.62 entry. During the bear market, NFLX stock fell more than 26% from a 52-week high in early March.

The FANG stock reported mixed Q1 financial results but it added 15.77 million new subscribers, crushing the 8.2 million subscribers analysts expected. Users went wild for its ""Tiger King"" documentary series, making it the most-streamed show in America in April, according to data analytics firm Parrot Analytics. ""Ozark,"" now in its third season, and the fantasy series ""The Witcher"" have also been popular binge watches.

The coronavirus pandemic has simply accelerated the existing trend toward video on demand and away from traditional pay TV, Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a report.

Netflix stock pulled back after its Q1 results, falling back to the top of its base before reversing higher in bullish fashion. NFLX stock dipped 0.2% to 435.55 on Friday, up nearly 5%. Shares are in a mini-consolidation above the prior base. It's not enough yet to form a proper pattern. But a move above the 449.52 peak could offer another entry into Netflix stock.

Apple Stock

Apple stock hit an all-time high of 327.85 on Jan. 29, just before the coronavirus stock market correction. AAPL stock has broken out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 288.35 and is now slightly extended. Apple stock could dip back into the buy zone or form another handle to offer a new entry point, but hasn't shown signs of that yet.

Apple stock rose 2.1% to 310.13 on Friday, capping a 7.3% weekly gain. The RS line for AAPL stock is at a new high.

Apple stock is No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products group.

The consumer electronics company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results in April as demand for services and wearable devices rose. But iPhone revenue fell 6.7% as the coronavirus pandemic hit production and consumer demand for smartphones.

Analysts say the pandemic could also delay the release of the iPhone 12, Apple's first expected 5G phone, from its projected September launch to between October and early December.

Amazon Stock

Amazon stock broke out of a cup base on April 14 with a buy point of 2,186.05. AMZN stock is currently extended above buy range. Shares rose 0.5% to 2,379.61 on Friday, climbing 4.1% for the week after rebounding from their 21-day line. AMZN stock could offer a new entry if its clears its record high of 2,475. Like Netflix stock, Amazon's short consolidation is far too short to be a proper pattern.

On May 1, Amazon stock tumbled nearly 8% following earnings, after hitting a record high heading into results. Q1 revenue growth beat Wall Street expectations. But earnings fell short and profit guidance was light as the e-commerce giant spends $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, to keep customers and employees safe.

Orders are soaring as customers are forced to stay at home amid the Covid-19 crisis. Amazon said it recently completed previous plans to hire 100,000 workers and will hire an additional 75,000 workers to meet growing demand. Amazon Web Services also is seeing strong demand from the stay-at-home trend.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jonathan-angrist-cognios-t-deliver-003110815.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T00:31:10+00:00,"Investing is hard. It used to be very easy. Hedge funds in the 80s and the 90s managed to return nearly 40% annually and their investors gladly paid them 2% of their assets and 20% of their profits as fees. Investors' net returns averaged above 30% annually and hedge funds managers gradually turned into billionaires.

Investors gradually shifted their assets into hedge funds. Hedge funds' assets under management first crossed the $1 billion mark, then the $100 billion and the trillion mark in this millennium. The demand for hedge funds created its own supply. The assets of well-known hedge funds run into tens of billions and most of them closed their doors to new investors. As a result investors handed their assets to the offshoots of these well-known hedge funds and other fund managers who were good at marketing but not very good at picking stocks.

Today, an average hedge fund can't generate more outperformance than the rich fees it charges. They found a neat solution that works for them but not for their investors. Initially hedge funds were called hedge funds because they were hedging their net exposure. Over the last 20 years, the net exposure of hedge funds started to creep up to 30%, 40%, 50%, and 80% level. This new approach enabled them to generate single digit returns during bull markets and enrich themselves. Nowadays, there are only a few hedge funds that have near zero net market exposure.

One of these hedge funds is John Brandmeyer and Jonathan C. Angrist's Cognios Capital. The Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund takes positions in undervalued U.S. stocks and balance this long exposure by shorting overvalued U.S. stocks across different industries. Cognios Capital isn't as greedy as other hedge funds and this market neutral strategy only charges 1.5% annually (no incentive fees). This means its investors will generate positive returns if Cognios' long positions beat its short positions by more than 1.5 percentage points.

Cognios was successful in delivering positive returns since its inception. The Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund returned 3% annually after fees. The fund returned 5.6% in 2015, -0.8% in 2016, 5% in 2017, 3.9% in 2018, -0.6% in 2019, and -2.1% during the first quarter of 2020. According to Cognios Capital's latest 13F filing, the fund's top 5 positions at the end of March were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

These are actually great large-cap stock picks. Four of these stocks are also among the top 5 hedge fund stocks which lost an average of only 6.9% during the first quarter. If you had invested only in the top 5 hedge fund stocks and shorted the S&P 500 Index, you would have returned nearly 13% with zero net market exposure. Hedge funds' consensus picks is a fertile area to find undervalued stocks.

Insider Monkey leaves no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, this investor can predict short term winners following earnings announcements with 77% accuracy, so we check out his stock picks. A former hedge fund manager is pitching the ""next Amazon"" in this video; again we are listening. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Insider Monkey's monthly newsletter beat the S&P 500 Index by 44 percentage points over the last 3 years. So, we are also good at picking winners like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-market-does-not-reflect-the-strength-of-the-economy-nyse-president-says-121233487.html,FB,2020-05-07T12:12:33+00:00,"The stock market has rallied in recent weeks while more than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment, drawing attention to a disconnect between the stock market and the real economy made apparent by the coronavirus outbreak.

In a newly released interview, New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham acknowledged that the resilient stock market does not reflect the condition of the economy, since relatively robust sectors like health care and tech make up a large portion of major indexes like the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

Wall Street will inevitably bounce back, Cunningham predicted, while deeper concerns remain about the outlook for the real economy that affects everyday Americans.

“When we say the market, it's not a reflection of the strength of the economy,” says Cunningham, who has served as NYSE president since 2018. “It's a reflection of the public sentiment of the stocks that were in that index that we're looking at.”

Since the S&P 500 reached a low point on March 23, the index had risen more than 26%, as of Wednesday afternoon. Tech giants Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB) made up 17.5% of the S&P 500 as of January, CNBC reported. On the whole, stocks belonging to those large tech firms have outperformed other companies and sectors amid the crisis.

“If the market is skewed — the index is skewed — by a number of technology stocks, people will say, ‘Hey, the market is up,’” she adds.

“When you look more broadly across their base, we are seeing strength in health care technology, consumer goods, but we're seeing other industries that are hurt more by this pandemic having a more difficult time.”

Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, appears on ""Influencers with Andy Serwer."" More

Payroll company ADP said on Wednesday that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly employment figures on Friday, analysts expect the worst losses since the Great Depression.

“It's important that we recognize Wall Street will recover from this and that won't be a problem,” she says. “That's why the packages that the government has had have been focusing on the individual and how do we put money back in their pocket.”

Cunningham made the remarks during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance’s “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

Cunningham is the first woman president in the centuries-long history of the NYSE. Prior to joining the NYSE in a senior capacity in 2012, Cunningham worked as a managing director and director of capital markets at Nasdaq.

She noted that the stock market’s resilience can divert attention away from individuals and sectors hit hard by the pandemic.

The relative strength of the market “doesn't reflect just the individuals that are impacted through this process,” she says.

“Clearly, we've seen restaurants and and so many gym owners and others that are struggling right now,” she adds.

Known for focusing on less efficient portions of the market, the activist investor's New York-based firm relies on fundamental research to find long-term opportunities among undervalued stocks that he believes will double in three to five years.

According to GuruFocus Real-Time Picks, a Premium feature, the guru sold 1.54 million shares of the Oakland, California-based cosmetics company on April 30, impacting the equity portfolio by -9.12%. The stock traded for an average price of $13.07 per share.

He now holds 2.36 million shares, which, at 15.36% of the equity portfolio, represents his largest holding as of the end of fourth-quarter 2019. GuruFocus data shows Cibelli has lost an estimated 27.35% on the investment since establishing it in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The beauty company, which sells its makeup at largely affordable price points, has a $622.98 million market cap; its shares were trading around $12.47 on Tuesday with a forward price-earnings ratio of 69.44, a price-book ratio of 2.57 and a price-sales ratio of 2.28.

The price chart shows the stock is trading near its price-book ratio but above its price-sales ratio.

6c08e91327c7fa702e99799d0396e335.png More

On March 30, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2020 guidance in spite of the potential impacts the Covid-19 pandemic has had on its sales. It expects 7% to 8% growth in net sales to between $274 million and $277 million and for adjusted earnings to range from 55 cents to 59 cents per share.

""We are seeing a change in consumer behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipate that our sales and Nielsen tracked channel results, while better than the category, will be significantly depressed during this time,"" Chairman and CEO Tarang Amin said. ""Our liquidity is strong and we are proactively managing spend. We remain confident in our long-term growth potential given our proposition of delivering prestige quality cosmetics and skin care at an extraordinary value.""

E.l.f. Beauty will report its fourth-quarter and full fiscal 2020 results on May 21.

GuruFocus rated e.l.f Beauty's financial strength 5 out of 10 on the back of weak interest coverage and a low Altman Z-Score of 1.13, warning investors it could be at risk of going bankrupt and is unable to cover its debt. Its return on invested capital is also less than its weighted average cost of capital, indicating it may not be capital efficient.

The company's profitability scored a 4 out of 10 rating. Even though its operating margin outperforms a majority of competitors, e.l.f. Beauty is weighed down by returns that underperform at least 70% of industry peers. It also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 7, which implies business conditions are stable.

With a 4.72% stake, Cibelli is the company's largest guru shareholder. Other top investors are Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio), Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio).

Portfolio composition

Cibelli's $221 million equity portfolio, which was composed of 12 stocks at the end of fourth-quarter 2019, was heavily invested in the communication services sector with a weight of 37.05%, followed by the consumer defensive space with a 35.97% weight.

a569a404406139eca4600eacac90842c.png More

After e.l.f. Beauty, the investor's largest positions are Grubhub Inc. (NYSE:GRUB), HD Supply Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:HDS), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL).

The bulls claimed Slack's collaborative platform would disrupt the traditional email and messaging markets and change how people worked. The bears claimed Slack's moat wasn't wide enough to fend off rivals like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and that it lacked a long-term path toward profitability.

The bulls initially lifted the stock from its debut price of $26 to the high $30s, but it subsequently stumbled back to the high $20s -- even as stay-at-home measures boosted interest in the stock. Slack certainly faces a lot of near-term challenges, but will its stock climb higher over the next five years?

What do the bears think about Slack?

Slack's revenue rose 110% in fiscal 2018, 82% in 2019, and 57% in 2020. In March, it estimated its revenue would rise 34%-37% in fiscal 2021, which ends next January. Slack's growth remains robust, but the bears believe its revenue growth could peak before it ever generates a profit. Slack expects its non-GAAP net loss to narrow from $0.28 per share in 2020 to $0.19-$0.21 in 2021, but its GAAP net losses -- which include big stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses -- could still widen.

On a GAAP basis, Slack's net loss widened from $138.9 million in 2019 to $568.4 million in 2020. SBC expenses, as a percentage of its revenue, jumped from 6% to a whopping 68% as the company expanded its workforce and subsidized salaries with big stock bonuses. That percentage should decline in 2020, but it highlights Slack's dependence on stock bonuses as it attempts to expand with negative cash flows.

Moreover, Microsoft recently revealed that its answer to Slack, Teams, had reached 75 million daily active users -- up from 44 million in March. Slack hasn't updated its daily active user count since last October (when it reached 12 million), and only recently revealed its platform hosted a peak of 12.5 million concurrent users in late March.

Microsoft is bundling Teams with its other Office 365 services, and that aggressive strategy -- which leverages its dominance of PC operating systems and productivity software -- could hurt Slack. Microsoft was reportedly interested in buying Slack four years ago, but it clearly believes it can crush it instead.

Slack's stock also isn't cheap relative to those of its peers. The stock trades at about 18 times the midpoint of its revenue forecast for fiscal 2021, and its slowing revenue growth, widening GAAP losses, and narrowing moat all make it tough to justify that premium.

What do the bulls think about Slack?

The bulls believe Slack's revenue growth will stabilize as it grows its base of larger customers. It also recently expanded its user base by acquiring Stride and HipChat Cloud from Atlassian.

Last quarter, Slack's total paid customers grew 25% annually to 110,000. 893 of those customers generated over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, up from 645 a year earlier. 47% of its revenue came from those larger clients, up from 41% last year.

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield recently dismissed the notion that Microsoft was a serious threat during a CNBC interview, noting that less than 30% of Microsoft's Office 365 users were using Teams. That percentage could rise, but it also suggests that there are still plenty of companies that don't wish to be tethered to Microsoft's ecosystem. Moreover, Slack's platform is already integrated with most of Microsoft's Office apps.

Slack's non-GAAP gross margin also expanded last year, which indicates it still has pricing power, and its free cash flow -- while negative -- is improving. Therefore, Slack's GAAP losses could eventually narrow as it weans itself off its dependence on stock bonuses. Slack was still holding $767 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of 2020, with zero debt -- so it won't be run off the road by Microsoft anytime soon.

Last but not least, Slack remains an attractive takeover target for other companies. Slack's valuation and enterprise value of $14 billion are a bit high, but cash-rich tech giants like Amazon, Cisco, and Alphabet's Google -- which all offer remote collaboration platforms -- could still be interested.

So where will Slack be in five years?

I believe the bear case against Slack is slightly stronger than the bull case. Slack's CEO might publicly dismiss Microsoft Teams as a rival, but its SEC filings clearly list Microsoft as its ""primary competitor.""

Slack's revenue growth will likely decelerate over the next five years, and it could struggle to narrow its losses while widening its moat. It could also be forced to issue debt or secondary stock offerings to maintain its cash flow. Those challenges, along with Slack's frothy valuation, could cause its stock to tread water and underperform other tech stocks over the next five years."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-amazon-facebook-disney-saw-their-chiefs-retake-control-142735464.html,AMZN,2020-05-11T14:27:35+00:00,"Over the past few months, some of the world’s biggest companies’ CEOs have reasserted themselves in ways they haven’t in the past.

Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has “jumped into action steering Facebook (FB) into a high-profile campaign,” the Wall Street Journal recently wrote after consolidating power on Facebook’s board last December.

Bob Iger, the longtime CEO of Disney (DIS), retired from top management in February, postponing something that he had planned to do for many years. He stayed on as the company’s chair, overseeing his successor Bob Chapek. But after a few weeks, as the New York Times reported, Iger has “smoothly reasserted control.”

The trend was solidified when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos “took back the wheel” at the company, putting a pause on rubbing elbows in Paris with French president Emmanuel Macron and Diane von Furstenberg to go back to day-to-day operations, personally managing the company’s responses to the COVID crisis, the surge in online shopping, and public safety issues.

Not everyone is opting for more control, however. AT&T’s (T) longtime CEO Randall Stephenson announced his retirement on April 24.

CEOs, especially at mega-caps like Amazon, Disney, and Facebook, often delegate much of their tasks to their direct reports, teams, chiefs of staff, much like a government executive. But when things get tough, executives often retrieve the control they’ve ceded and take matters into their own hands.

Leading in crisis

The most common reason for this phenomenon, according to Mary-Hunter McDonnell, a professor in management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, is because people – employees, shareholders, customers – look to decisive and rock-solid leadership during periods of uncertainty, chaos, and fear.

“Even unpopular presidents will see this bump in support and polling,” she said. “I think the same is true in a corporate setting. A CEO, if they’ve taken a step back, needs to be front-stage to rally around.”

Though companies are often governed by committee, executive leadership is key, and people want to believe there’s one person protecting the company and taking it forward.

“Given the extent of the disruption to people’s lives that this pandemic is introducing, everyone in every organization is looking to their leader for what to do next,” said McDonnell. “I know we’re doing it at the University of Pennsylvania and everyone is waiting to hear what they’re supposed to do.“

It’s also a question of morale. As the crisis has raged, over 143 CEOs cut executive pay, with CEOs like Delta’s Ed Bastian leading the way trying to stave off layoffs and lobbying the government for assistance. Employees appreciate when management fights for their benefit.

Morale, McDonnell said, cannot be delegated, so when it’s needed, the CEO’s job is clear-cut.

“When facing stressful events with uncertainty in stressful situations — tender offers, hostile takeovers, changes in control — people are worried about losing jobs, and a CEO's job in those moments is to keep morale high,” she said.

The coronavirus is an exaggerated example.

More than morale

It’s not just a matter people needing a leader in a psychological sense. McDonnell said it’s just as much a matter of efficiency. During crises, the usual operation channels are rattled, turning expected events and processes chaotic."

Best Stocks To Buy And Watch In Coronavirus Stock Market

Companies like streaming pioneer Netflix and Zoom Video Communications (ZM) are on the list and certainly qualify as top stocks to watch as they benefit from social distancing and work-from-home trends in the coronavirus stock market. But they're by no means alone.

Here's an overview of some the best stocks to buy and watch as we look for the next crop of stock market winners to emerge.

Apple Stock

Apple broke out of a cup with handle at the end of April. The tech giant recovered from a sell-off that began in October 2018 and is now back near a new all-time high, with its relative strength line in new high ground. Apple topped analyst estimates for its March quarter when it reported on April 30.

Microsoft Stock

The cloud computing and software leader has rebounded from a sharp sell-off in tandem with the coronavirus crash. Microsoft stock has now cleared a 180.10 buy point, putting it just below a new all-time high. In a sign of market leadership, its relative strength is floating around a new high.

PayPal Stock

The peer-to-peer and online payments pioneer bolted higher Thursday after reporting earnings. PayPal stock is now extended past a 124.55 buy point. The Silicon Valley-based company was recently featured on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index.

Netflix Stock

The big shift to shutting down movie theaters has helped spur interest in at-home streaming services from Netflix and others. Netflix stock has benefited from that, with it now trading just below a new all-time high. In the last two quarters, the company has generated triple-digit earnings growth, including a 107% rise in Q1.

Facebook Stock

The social media giant is trying to close in on a 224.30 buy point. A breakout would lift Facebook stock to an all-time high. The company reported Q1 earnings on April 29, posting a 101% gain. Sales growth for the quarter slipped from 25% to 18%. To help customers cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, Facebook is working to enhance real-time video experiences and live game-streaming.

More Breakouts And Setups In Coronavirus Stock Market

A strengthening stock market rebound and the release of Q1 earnings has the potential to push several leading stocks to new heights.

ServiceNow (NOW), which has been featured on IBD Long-Term Leaders and several other lists, broke out on May 5, just after reporting 57% EPS and 33% quarterly sales growth. In the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds, 24 leading money managers invested $574 million in ServiceNow stock.

Nvidia (NVDA) is also among top stocks to watch. After going through a steep correction that began in October 2018, the chip designer and leading AI stock is now testing a new all-time high. Nvidia is also on the latest list of new buys by the best funds, with 37 institutional investors picking up $875 million in shares.

So as the rebound from the coronavirus stock market crash tries to gather steam, keep a close eye on where the best mutual funds are placing their bets. And be sure to stay focused on the ""three big rocks"" of CAN SLIM investing to help ensure that you're placing your own bets on the top prospects.
